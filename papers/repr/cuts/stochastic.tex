%%% Example: the worlds.. 
and $\V_\none(\sfM) = \V(\sfM) \cup \{ \none g, f \none, \none\none \}$. 
	As this $\sfM$ is strict, all of these additional worlds get zero probability. 
		\todo{Replace with \Cref{ex:teacher} once finalized for a more illustrative example.}
	
	Finally, let $\mu_\none$ be the unique distribution on $\V_\none(M)$ that assigns point mass to $\none$ for every variable.
