%As we will see, one reason these inconsistencies are difficult to avoid is our conceptual modularity: features of the world can be noticed, forgotten, and fragments of beliefs can be locally recombined long before they crystallize into global distributions or theorems.

%Separately, people enjoy conceptual modularity: features of the world (like the random variables which generate a graphical model) can be noticed, forgotten, and beliefs about their dependencies can be incorporated into our mental states without all of one's distantly unrelated beliefs.
%These two features are in fact related, and we present here a representation of uncertainty which models both.






%	Standard notions of uncertainty, including probability \cite{halpern2017reasoning}}, take for granted a set of possible worlds; approaches such as language-based games, and
%	We can exploit the absence of a global consistency mandate to entirely remove the computational overhead and assumptions required to make structural changes to the graph (sometimes incurring inconsistency). 
%	Despite their flexibility, \MNs\ perhaps counter-intuitively offer a way to recognize when something has gone wrong, and
