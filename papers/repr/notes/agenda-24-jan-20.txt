Worries about existing work:
	- peudomarginals in Ising Model.
	- standard "Over-complete" paramterization.
	- 𝕃 vs 𝕄, Bethe approximation to entropy 
	- My issue with factor graphs taking care of everything.
	- "convexifying Bethe Energy" will do similar things to adding nodes.

Things to work out

 - Plate Models, First Order, Experiences, etc.
 

Results
	- Conjecture: [[M]]_H is the same as the 



Individual bits of feedback: clarification.
 	- "Cut this. Either make multi-tailed part of the syntax or explain how they can be captured."
