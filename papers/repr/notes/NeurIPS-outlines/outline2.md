Things I need to now cover
 - Decide on formulation 1 vs formulation 2. Discuss. Figure out exactly how  I can describe. 
 - Decide on which of the \alpha fixes I can get behind.
 
[1] Try to explain as qualitative vs quantitative parts separately
[2] 


For paper: just define unique dist as limit as \gamma -> 0.
	(corresponds to focus on observational probabilities)
Mention that 


Qualitative picture: trace just in terms of randomness.
Where did the randomness come from? 
 
 

Things that might be re-inserted...
 - Alphas, Betas
 - Information Profile
 - Discussion of two formulations
 - More general semantics: raph of \alpha vs \beta



# Section 1 [Introduction]
Same as overleaf, except 
- I think we need to nod to factor graphs or MRFs earlier (?)

# Section 2 [Formalism and Syntax]


# Section 3 [Semantics]
Definition: Set of distributions, inconsistency. 
We can eliminate a lot of redundancy and a huge chunk of text. No subsections if just definitions.

## Sec 3.1 [PDGs as Sets of Distributions]
(same as before)

## Sec 3.2 [PDGs as Distribution Scorings]
Here we need

## Sec 3.1 [PDGs as Unique Distributions]



# Section 4 [Relations to other Graphical Models]
- List theorems more quickly without as much discussion. 

## Sec 4.1 [Bayseian Networks]

## Sec 4.2 [Factor Graphs, MRFs, Dependency Networks]

# Section 5 [Conclusions]
