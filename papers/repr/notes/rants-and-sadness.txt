RANTS:
	Once I strip away from the paper: the probabilistic semantics, the intuitions that are too fuzzy, the notation, the proofs that I hide in the appendix or didn't have time for, the addition that patches holes and makes it possible to do logical modeling, the relations to all of the other things (i.e., the true motivations for why I'm doing this)--- and then I try to replace it all with my own shitty writing and Joe's best guess at what I want to say, the paper is kind of shitty. 

	Joe wants to cut all the stuff I like and I want to cut all the rest. I worry that the project is only interesting to me when you see it all at once.  I worry that Joe doesn't know the fields I'm trying to work in well enough to comment, but still feels strongly that anyone should be able to read any paper, and is not properly utilizing the ethos of math. He says it's an empirical question whether or not other people can read my style, and I want to test this. 

	I read a lot of other accepted UAI papers today and they have way more technical content and less explanation. We have some explanations that appear multiple times and cover multiple paragraphs and still Joe will tell me that it's not well-enough motivated. I'll make small edits for weeks and then when he rewrote a large chunk of paper, (which I guarantee he spent almos	There is one final property of $\bbr{-}_\Set$ that may be interesting on its own, and will become useful later:

	\begin{lemma}[restate=thmsetconvex] 
		\label{prop:convex}
		$\bbr{M}_\Set$ is convex, for any \MN\ $M$.
	\end{lemma}%t no time on compared to what I have), he EXPANDED some of them. I'm super worried. 

	- There aren't enough examples
	- The theorems he cares about are super easy special cases of other things that exist, that nobody's bothered to prove before.
	- I wanted to run some actual experiments, but got too stuck on writing to actually do this.


	I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing. I don't know how to write in a way that Joe likes, and now I'm second guessing all my writing and revising things dozens of times before anyone sees it, leaving it fragmented and impossible to follow on a large scale. I've never been able to write good things except all at once.

	I'm also realizing that Joe hasn't read the second half of my paper ever, in which I address a whole ton of the BN issues. He's telling me to add things and I'm confused, but the truth is I actually have some of them elsewhere. He wants an intro to thermo but it's now in the appendix. He wants all the BN stuff in one place and for me to focus on it, and it is, just not there
	
	I'm just generally super frustrated that I keep writing things, and then he'll tell me to cut it all, and then it'll just be `why is there nothing here?`
		

	I have spent SO long thinking about this and the way that it needs to be presented and what the moral is; now I feel like I'm being bulldozed. I go back and forth on decisions dozens of times. Joe makes a wonky one once and I have to live with it and restructure the paper; he later complains about things not being properly motivated. I can't write well enough to do this :(
	
	
	Writing math without notation makes me sad :(
	
	Some of these edits make me so angry; he's just repeating things I've said before multiple times. I don't know how to even respond to them.
