PDGs are a powerful tool for representing local probabilistic information. They offer a semantics parameterized by \gammma > 0, which always generalizes Bayesian Networks, and precisely matches that of factor graphs when $\gamma=1$, exposing an implicit trade-off between quantitative and qualitative data, which are fused in a factor graph.

Both the qualitative and quantitative parts of a PDG can be inconsistent, though dealing with the former is a complex endeavor which we do not improve upon here. Because factor graphs effectively fuse the two kinds of 


Like factor graphs, PDGs are incredibly modular, but unlike factor graphs, subgraphs of PDGs continue to have local meaning.

In contrast with existing models.
