================ STRUCTURE OF PAPER ===================

THEOREM: any subgraph of a \MN\ is still a \MN



**MRF/expfamily**: 
specifying a probability distribution by linear sum of energy potentials (each world has an energy). (@fixed temp = scale variable), is equivalent to a probability distribution.

By specifying a set of soft constraints on distributions, we are specifying an energy landscape for a distirbution. A world is a special case of a distribution, so this subsumes the other approach. 

Worry: infinite regress.
