The general idea is as follows: there are some bits of you that only exist in very certain places, and are context dependent. It's not like there's just one agent that is ``you'' and makes all of your decisions --- or maybe it can be viewed this way, but we might be able to get better explanatory power and approximate agents better if we recognize that you can build agents up in a nested manner.

Right, sow what does this have to do with my diagrams, which have nodes and edges? What does this have to do with belief revision? Or dynamic preferences?
