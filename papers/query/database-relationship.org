* Representations of Databases
** Relational
R ⊆ A1 × A2 × A3
or equivalently R: A1 × A2 × A3 → 2

No intersection and hence inconsistent:
  - isFriend + isEnemy:
  - The Empty Set

But when we write a table in a database, we don't mean to say any choice of
domain elements has occured, and even if it has, we do not necessarily want to
assert that the relationship holds of them.

By representing $f$ in un-curried form, we only need to solve the second
problem. Specifically, suppose we indeed wanted to assert the truth of each
predicate. A relation is defined by the set of tupples it contains, and because
the constraint graph gives a set of admissible tuples, the resulting set of
joint settings is the set of

Δ(X) → Δ(Y)

Effectively, we have now

What should we do when we get the empty relation?
