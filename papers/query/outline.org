#+TITLE: Outline of Inference And Dynamics

* Inference
by "inference", i mean ability to answer queries.
there are many different kinds of queries that one could answer.

** Kinds of Queries
*** Unconditional Queries, e.g,. ~Pr( Y )~
Gives an estimate of the unconditional probability of  Y.

*VARIANTS*
- Give a sample answer and a score, rather than the real one. (this is a straightforward  fs)
-


*** Conditional Queries, e.g.,  ~Pr( Y | X )~
***  Counter-factual Queries,  e.g., ~Pr( Y | do(X₁, X₂) )~
*** Probabilistic Logic Queries, e.g., ~Pr( ∃ x . R(x) )~
*** Stochastic Logical Queries, e.g.,  ~[∃ x. R(x)]~
+ Returns :: a boolean, drawn from
*** Travelsal Queries, e.g., ~john.manager.manager.department.secretary~
*** Sampling Queries, e.g,.  ~Draw x ~ ⟦M⟧*(X | Y=y, Z=z, do(X₃ = x₃))~
* Dynamics
