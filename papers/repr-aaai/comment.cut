A PDG clearly encodes more information than just the
distribution: this is true for both Bayesian Networks
and Factor Graphs as well. In both cases, this is
sometimes cast as a flaw, as this makes them poor
choices as canonical descriptions of distributions,
which is why so much attention is given to I-maps in
\cite{koller2009probabilistic}.

However, meaning beyond the distribution has not been empirically damaging. Despite being less expressive and obscuring independence relations, BNs continue to be a more popular modeling tool. The causal picture they can provide, beyond anything in the distribution, is evidently worth a lot.
