\section{Introduction}

In this paper we introduce yet another graphical for modeling beliefs,
\emph{Probabilistic Dependency Graphs} (PDGs). There are already many
such models in the literature, including Bayesian networks (BNs) and
factor graphs. (For an overview, see \citeauthor{KF09}.)
Why does the world need one more?  

Our original motivation for introducing PDGs was to be able capture
inconsistency. We want to be able to model the process of resolving
inconsistency; to do so, we have to model the inconsistency itself. But our
approach to modeling inconsistency has many other advantages. In particular,
PDGs are significantly more modular than other directed graphical models:
operations like restriction and union that are easily done with PDGs are
difficult or impossible to do with other representations.

We start with some examples to motivate PDGs and illustrate some of these properties.  

\begin{example} \label{ex:guns-and-floomps}
Grok is visiting a neighboring district. From prior reading, she thinks it likely (probability
.95) that guns are illegal here. Some brief conversations with locals lead her to believe believe with
probility .1, that the law prohibits floomps.

% The obvious way to represent this as a BN involves two binary random variables,
% $F$ (taking values $\{f, \overline f\}$), indicating the legality of floomps,
% and $G$ (taking values $g, \overline g$) indicating the legality of guns. 
The obvious way to represent this as a BN is to use two random variables
$F$ and $G$ (respectively taking values $\{f, \smash{\overline f}\}$ and $g, \overline g$), indicating the respective legalities of owning floomps and guns.
%oli12 no paragraph break here.
The semantics of a 
%oli12
% Bayes Net
BN
offer her two choices: either assume that $F$ and $G$
% are independent and give (unconditional) probabilities of $F$ and $G$, or we
to be independent and give (unconditional) probabilities of $F$ and $G$, or
choose a direction of dependency, and give one of the two unconditional
probabilities and a conditional probability distribution. 
%oli12:
% As there is no reason
% to believe that either variable depends on the other, 
As there is no reason to choose either direction of dependence, the
natural choice is to 
assume independence, giving her the 
%oli12: combining figures
BN on the left of \Cref{fig:gun-floomp-diagram}.

Starting with $p$, Grok's first instinct is to
simply incorporate the conditional information by adding $F$ as a parent of
$G$, and then associating
the cpd
$p$ with $G$. But then what should she do
with the original probability she had for $G$?  Should she just discard it?
It is easy to check that there is no

that is consistent with

the two original priors on $F$ and $G$ and also

is to represent the information with a BN, which always represents a consistent
distribution, she must resolve the inconsistency. 





However,

% How to resolve it may be clearer 
% if you can get confirmation that guns are indeed floomps, or read the

sorting this out immediately may not be ideal.
For instance, if the inconsistency arises from a conflation between
two definitions 
of ``gun'', a resolution will have destroyed the original cpds. A
better use of computation may be to notice the inconsistency and look
up the actual law. 

By way of contrast, consider the corresponding PDG. In a PDG, the cpds are
attached to edges, rather than nodes of the graph.
%oli12: this discussion is a distraction; it has nothing to do with PDGs over BNs.

The ability of PDGs to model inconsistency, as illustrated in
\Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, appears to have come at a significant cost. We seem
to have lost a key benefit of BNs: the ease with which they can
capture

\begin{example}[emulating a BN]\label{ex:smoking}

We now consider the classic (quantitative) Bayesian network $\cal B$, which has
four binary variables indicating whether a person ($C$) develops cancer, ($S$)
smokes, ($\mathit{SH}$) is exposed to second-hand smoke, and ($\mathit{PS}$) has
parents who smoke, presented graphically in \Cref{subfig:smoking-bn}. We now
walk through what is required to represent $\cal B$ as a PDG, which we call
$\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$, shown as the solid nodes and edges in
\Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg}.

\label{fig:smoking-bn+pdg}
\end{figure}

We start with the nodes corresponding to the variables in $\cal B$, together
with the special node $\sf 1$ from \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}; we add an edge
from ${\sf 1}$ to $\mathit{PS}$, to which we associate the unconditional
probability given by the cpd for $\mathit{PS}$ in $\cal B$. We can also re-use
the cpds for $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$, assigning them, respectively, to the edges
$PS \to S$ and $PS \to SH$ in $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$.
There are two remaining problems: (1) modeling the remaining table in $\cal B$,
which corresponds to the conditional probability of $C$ given $S$ and $SH$; and
(2) recovering the additional
%oli12 added
conditional
independence assumptions in the BN. 

For (1), we cannot just add the edges $S \to C$ and $SH \to C$ that are present
%joe11: line shaving
%in $\cal B$, because, as we saw in \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, this would mean
in $\cal B$. As we saw in \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, this would mean
supplying two \emph{separate} tables, one indicating the probability of $C$
given $S$, and the other indicating the probability of $C$ given
%joe11: more line shaving
%$\mathit{SH}$. Doing this would lose significant information that is
$\mathit{SH}$.  We would lose significant information that is
present in $\cal B$  about 
how $C$ depends jointly on $S$ and $SH$. To distinguish the joint dependence on
$S$ and $\mathit{SH}$, for now, we draw an edge with two tails---a
\emph{hyperedge}---that completes the diagram in \Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg}. 
%
With regard to (2), there are many distributions consistent with the conditional
marginal probabilities in the cpds, and the independences presumed by $\cal B$
need not hold for them. 
%oli12
% Rather than encoding the extra probabilistic information as cpds,
Rather than trying to distinguish between them with additional constraints,
we develop a a scoring-function semantics for PDGs
%oli12: hmm, the consistency is part of the scoring function. 
%    , and show that, among all distributions consistent with
%    $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$,
%joe11: so we're encoding the constraints in the semantics of the
%scoring function, rather than directly in the PDG.  This makes it a
%``soft'' constraint.  We could say that somewhere, but this seems
%like the wrong place.

%arbitrary) cpds'' means 
%which, despite an emphasis on matching (potentially arbitrary) cpds,

% for the appropriate scoring function, 
% the unique distribution with a minimum

This allows us to recover the semantics of Bayesian networks without requiring the independencies that they assume.

%But now suppose that we get information beyond that captured by the
Next suppose that we get information beyond that captured by the original BN.

control (call the cpd for this $p$); we would like to add this information to
$\cal B$. The first step is clearly to add a new node labeled $T$, for ``tanning
bed use''.  But simply making $T$ a parent of $C$ (as clearly seems appropriate,
given that the incidence of cancer depends on tanning bed use) requires a
substantial expansion of the cpd; in particular, it requires us to make
assumptions about the interactions between tanning beds and smoking.  
%
The corresponding PDG, $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$, on the other hand, has no
trouble: We can simply add the node $T$ with an edge to $C$ that is associated
with $\mat p$.  But note that doing this makes it possible for our knowledge to
be inconsistent. To take a simple example, if the distribution on $C$ given $S$
and $H$ encoded in the original cpd was always deterministically ``has cancer''
for every possible value of $S$ and $H$, but the distribution according to the
new cpd from $T$ was deterministically ``no cancer'', the resulting PDG would be
inconsistent.  
%
\end{example}


We have seen that we can easily add information to PDGs; removing information is
equally painless.   

\begin{example}[restriction]\label{ex:grok-ablate}
%oli12
% After the communist uprising, 
%joe11
%  After the communist party came to power,
  After the Communist party came to power,
  children were raised communally, and so parents' smoking habits no longer had any impact on them. Grok is reading her favorite book on graphical models, and she realizes that while the node $\mathit{PS}$ in \Cref{subfig:smoking-bn} has lost its usefulness, and nodes $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$ no longer ought to have $\mathit{PS}$ as a parent, the other half of the diagram---that is, the node $C$ and its dependence on $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$---should apply as before.
%oli4: this next sentence is less useful, and can be
    %removed; its purpose is to pre-emptively push against
    %a desire to margnialize and get a new BN.  
%joe4: let's remove it
% \begin{edge} 
% 	The rise of the communist party also came with changes in smoking habits, so a new unconditional distribution on $S$ could not be obtained by eliminating the variable $PS$. 
% \end{edge}
Grok has identified two obstacles to modeling deletion of information from a BN
by simply deleting nodes and their associated cpds. First, this restricted model
is technically no longer a BN (which in this case would require unconditional
distributions on $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$), but rather a \emph{conditional} BN
\cite{KF09}, which allows for these nodes to be marked as observations;
observation nodes do not have associated beliefs. Second, even regarded as a
conditional BN, the result of deleting a node may introduce \emph{new}
independence information, incompatible with the original BN. For instance, by
deleting the node $B$ in a chain $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, one concludes
that $A$ and $C$ are independent, a conclusion incompatible with the original BN
containing all three nodes.   
%joe7*: shortened significantly.  I don't think it's
   %worth agonizing this over this.
%oli12: Your shortening is excellent :)
%joe11: :-)
PDGs do not suffer from either problem.  We can easily delete the
nodes labeled 1 and $PS$ in \Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg} to get the
restricted PDG shown in the figure, which captures Grok's updated information.
%oli12: I want to keep some of the material  underneath it for the
%full paper though. 
% I have rewritten a lot of it.
%joe17: I can live with this in the paper
%\begin{vfull}
The resulting PDG has no edges leading to $S$ or $\mathit{SH}$, and hence no
distributions specified on them; no special modeling distinction between
observation nodes and other nodes are required. Because PDGs do not directly
make independence assumptions, the information in this fragment is truly a
subset of the information in the whole PDG. 	
%\end{vfull}
% 
\end{example}

Being able to form a well-behaved local picture and restrict knowledge is
useful, but an even more compelling reason to use PDGs is their ability to
aggregate information. 
	
\begin{example}\label{ex:grok-union}
Grok dreams of becoming Supreme Leader ($\it SL$), and has come up with a plan.
She has noticed that people who use tanning beds have significantly more power
and than those who don't. Unfortunately, her mom has always told her that

%oli12: shortening

Grok thinks people will make fun of her if she uses a tanning bed and
gets cancer, making becoming Supreme Leader impossible. This mental state is
depicted as  a PDG on the left of \Cref{fig:grok-combine}.
%oli12 we haven't left out anything more than we have earlier.
% (where we have left out the cpds, to avoid clutter).


Grok is reading about graphical models because she vaguely remembers that the
variables in \Cref{ex:smoking} match the ones she already knows about. When she
finishes reading the statistics on smoking and the original study on tanning
beds (associated to a cpd $\mat p$ in \Cref{ex:smoking}), but before she has
time to reflect, we can represent her (conflicted) knowledge state as the union
of the two graphs, depicted graphically on the right of \Cref{fig:grok-combine}.

This is not the case in general

% with a BN.
for BNs.
Note that the PDG that Grok used to
represent her two different sources of information (the mother's wisdom and the
study) regarding the distribution of $C$ is a \emph{multigraph}: there are two
edges from $T$ to $C$, with inconsistent information. Had we not not allowed
multigraphs, we would need to choose between the two edges, or represent the
information some other (arguably less natural) way. As we are already allowing
inconsistency, merely recording both is much more in keeping with the way we
have handled other types of uncertainty. 
%		
%TODO: I should not say this yet. This is a related story that I haven't told yet. 
%Moreover, if Grok were to later discover that her mother had been faithfully transmitting the results of an unrelated study, she would be justified in increasing her certainty that a cpd roughly like $\mat p$ and $\mat q$ were correct.
% This suggests a result that is perhaps obvious in retrospect: the mere \emph{possibility} of inconisistency increases the value of consistency. For an agent that is guaranteed to be consistent by design, corroborating evidence has no value. 
\end{example}

Not all inconsistencies are equally egregious. For example, even though the cpds
$p$ and $q$ are different, they are numerically close, so, intuitively, the PDG on the right in
\Cref{fig:grok-combine} is not very inconsistent.

\commentout{
While a PDG is in some sense merely a set of constraints (the cpds), these constraints themselves have a useful computational meaning. Regarding cpds as stochastic matrices, we can get cpds corresponding to paths by multiplying them; equivalently, thought of as probabilistic functions, we can compose them.
	For instance, in \Cref{ex:grok-union}, if we were to give Grok
        unconditional probabilities in the form of vectors
        $\smash{(\vec s, \vec h, \vec t)}$ over the possible values of
        $\mathit{S, SH}$ and $\mathit T$ respectively, she could
        compute three distinct estimates for $\mathit{SL}$. This is
        perhaps clearest visually, but for clarity, if $\mat S$ is
        the cpd for the orange hyperedge that computes $C$ from
        $\mathit{S, SH}$, and $\mat L$ is the cpd for the

        applicable even if given only $\vec t$, and the last requires

\section{Syntax}\label{sec:formal+syntax}
We now provide formal definitions for PDGs.        
Although it is possible to formalize PDGS with hyperedges directly,
    we opt for a different approach here, in which PDGs have only regular edges,
and hyperedges are captured using a simple construction
that involves adding an extra node.

\vfull{\footnote{In the factor graph literature,
          especially with regard to loopy belief propagation
          \cite{wainwright2007graphical}, it is common to
          call a collection of marginals that are not
          necessarily all compatible with a distribution
          \emph{pseudomarginals}, making a PDG in some sense a
          collection of `conditional' pseudomarginals. This
          gives an alternate, more technically precise
          expansion of PDG as ``Pseudomarginal Dependency Graph''.}}

%distraction.  I don't see the connection between a failure of
%consistency and a failure to commute (and I have a Ph.D. in
%mathematics and no exactly what the words mean).  I *strongly* object
%to including this.  If you have some interesting theorems to prove,
%you can write another paper on it.  You can also talk about it in
%your thesis if you really care.  But not in the paper!  Even if we
%could afford the space (which we can't) I would strongly object.
%oli12*: Are you serious that you don't see the connection?? We should
%talk about this.
%joe11: Yes, I'm serious.  We can discuss it after the deadline.
% I really do think it's a massive oversight not to at least mention
% this. I can see a world where mentioning this is the most important
% thing we do in the paper. I also think you hugely underestimate how
% many people care about commutative diagrams, what this buys you, and
% the implications for mathematical reasonsing.
%joe11: There are certainly people who care about this material.  They
%are an extremely small subset of the NeurIPS community.  We're
%submitting this paper to NeurIPS.  You're more than welcome to write
%a paper about this for a conference where there are substantially more pepole
%who care about commutative diagrms.
%joe17: We *definitely* should not be talking about commuatative
%diagrams at this point in the paper (frankly, I don't think we should
%talk about them at all in the paper
%oli20: agreed, did not intend for this to resurface.

    We have stressed that edges are interpreted differently in PDGs than
    in Bayesian Networks. Readers should be aware that this approach is
    closely related to the notion of a \emph{commutative diagram}, a
    common representation in pure mathematics. For those familiar with
    them, the potential failure of a PDG to be consistent is analogous to
    the possibility that a diagram could fail to commute.

%joe4*: cut this paragraph.  It's a distraction.  Moreover, BN's don't
%need this ``trick'', because of the way they interpret the edges.  
\section{Semantics}\label{sec:semantics}
%oli12: I dislike the sentence below. Primarily, it seems like
%cheating to come up 
% with totally different semantics depending on what you want to capture, and 
% we're really not doing that --- our three semantics are intimately
% related, and 
% can all be represented naturally in terms of the scoring function. 
%   There is more than one way of giving semantics to a PDG.  
%oli12: I think something along these lines has the additional benefit of 
% quickly speaking to why we're doing this (people write down cpds all the time). 
Although the meaning of an individual cpd is clear, we have not yet given 
%joe11: you seem to like using ``local'' and ``global'' a lot.
%Although I understand what you intend here, I'm still uncomfortable
%about the usage, because it suggests that there's a local semantics.
%oli13: There is a local semantics: the cpd itself already is a local
%probabilistic object. It is already useful on its own. You can even compose
%them, etc,... But there's ambiguity in stitching them together. In some sense
%this is the problem we address.
%joe12: but we have never talked about local semanatics or local
%probabilistic objects.  This is not the time to start!
%oli14: Anecdotally, this is the point that convinced me that semantics was 
% actually worthwhile. Many people just use cpds by themselves; I'd guess many
% ML people will be wondering why we need anything else if we already have
% the cpds that we need. Can't you just do math with those? In any
% case, "global" 
% is good enough for me.
%joe11: I left it in with the quotation marks.
%oli13: The "local" and "global" is going to also help make sure these terms
% don't come out of the blue later in the paper.
%joe12: but they come out of the blue here.  Do we really need them?
%Are they adding something useful to the discussion?  (As you can
%guess, I don't think that they do.)
%oli14: I think they are. I think this "global" here is already worth it
% even if we don't follow up. I have plenty of following up to do, but
% probably anything substantive won't make it. I have just a few
% characters on the final page. 
%PDGs any global semantics. We discuss three related approaches. The first
%joe14
%PDGs a ``global'' semantics. We discuss three related approaches. The
PDGs a ``global'' semantics. We discuss three related approaches to doing so.
The first is the simplest: we associate with a PDG the set of distributions that
are consistent with it. This set will be empty if the PDG is inconsistent.
%
The second approach associates a PDG with a scoring function, indicating the fit
of an arbitrary distribution $\mu$, and can be thought of as a \emph{weighted}
set of distributions \cite{HL12}. This approach allows us to distinguish
inconsistent PDGs, while the first approach does not. The third approach chooses
the distributions with the best score, typically associating with a PDG a unique
distribution.

%joe18*: Oliver, can you reinstate subsection numbers?
%oli21: Ah, only section numbers. Changed.   
\subsection{PDGs As Sets Of Distributions}\label{sec:set-of-distribution-semantics} 
We have been thinking of a PDG as a collection of constraints on distributions,
specified by matching cpds. From this perspective, it is natural to consider the
set of all distributions that are consistent with the constraints.

\begin{defn} \label{def:set-semantics} 
%oli22: minor expansion to clarify that this works for both unweighted and
% weighted PDGs.
% If $\dg M\sheq\pdgvars[]$ is a PDG,
%joe20
%If $\dg M$ is an PDG (weighted or unweighted) with edges $\Ed$ and
If $\dg M$ is a PDG (weighted or unweighted) with edges $\Ed$ and
cpds $\mat p$, 
let $\SD{\dg M}$ be the \emph{s}et of
\emph{d}istributions over the variables in $\dg M$ 
%oli12: "the conditional probabilities" is ambiguous, I thought it was reffering
%to p. For a joint distribution p, it's the conditional _marginal_ on the
%appropriate variables that's of interest.
% for which the conditional probabilities are exactly 
%joe11
%whose conditional marginals on are exactly those given by $\mat p$.
whose conditional marginals are exactly those given by $\mat p$.
%oli20: edges have labels (but no need to draw attention to them)
% That is, $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ iff, for all edges $L = (X,Y) \in \Ed$,  $x \in
That is, $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ iff, for all edges $L \in \Ed$ from $X$
to $Y$,  $x \in 
\V(X)$,  and $y \in \V(Y)$, we have that $\mu(Y \!=\! y \mid X\sheq x) = \bp(x)$.
\notation{Formally,		
    \[ \SD[\Big]{\dg M} = \!\left\{\mu \!\in\! \Delta \V_\none (\dg M) \middle|\!
        \begin{array}{l}
        \mu(B\!\! =\!\! b \mid A\!\!=\!\! a) \geq \bp(b \mid a) \\[0.1em]
        ~\text{$\forall (A, B,\ell) \!\in\! \Ed$, $a \!\in\!\V(A)$, $b \!\in\! \V(B)$} 
   		\end{array}\!\!\! \right\}\]
    }
% $\dg M$ is \emph{consistent} if $\SD{\dg M} \ne \emptyset$, and inconsistent otherwise.
% $\dg M$ is \emph{inconsistent} if $\SD{\dg M} = \emptyset$, and consistent otherwise.
$\dg M$ is \emph{inconsistent} if $\SD{\dg M} = \emptyset$, and \emph{consistent} otherwise.
\end{defn}
%joe20
%%oli22: I still want to say this 
%joe20: cut; this is the wrong place to mention convexity
%\begin{remark}
%	$\SD{\dg M}$ is a convex set of distributions,
%	and independent of the weights $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
%	
%\end{remark}
Note that $\SD{\dg M}$ is independent of the weights $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

%joe17*: This breaks teh flow here.  If it were go anywhere, it should
%be in the appendix
%oli20: oops, I don't want it in the AAAI submission either.
\vleftovers{
	It turns out that this semantics only results in convex sets. This may provide useful intuition, and we will prove a stronger version of this statement that corresponds to our second semantics.
	\begin{lemma}[restate=thmsetconvex] 
		\label{prop:convex}
		$\SD{\dg M}$ is convex, for any PDG $\dg M$.
	\end{lemma}

	Note that being inconsistent is not the same things as \emph{over-constrained}: 	
	\begin{defn}
		$\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ is over-constrained if there exists
		  \emph{some $\mat p'$} assigning cpds to the same edges as
		  $\mat p$, such that $(\N, \Ed, \V, \mat p')$ is inconsistent
		  \notation{(i.e., $\SD{\N^\dg M, \Ed^\dg M, \V^\dg M, \mat p}
			= \emptyset$)}, and under-constrained if there are
		  multiple distributions in $(\N, \Ed, \V, \mat p')$ for
		  \emph{every such $\mat p'$}, making this a property of the
		  qualitative PDG $(\N, \Ed, \V)$.  
	\end{defn}

	We know that an under-constrained PDG is consistent without even looking at the tables. However if a we know that an \emph{over-constrained} PDG is actually consistent (when it could have easily contradicted itself), the information provides corroborating evidence, and one can take this as support in favor of the beliefs. 
}

\subsection{PDGs As Distribution Scoring Functions} \label{sec:scoring-semantics}   

We now generalize the previous semantics by viewing a PDG $\dg M$ as a
\emph{scoring function} that, given an arbitrary distribution $\mu$ on $\V(\dg
M)$, returns a real-valued score indicating how well $\mu$ fits $\dg M$.
Distributions with the lowest (best) scores are those that most closely match
the cpds in $\dg M$, and contain the fewest unspecified correlations.
% We now make this precise.

We start with the first component of the score, which assigns higher scores to
distributions that require a larger perturbation in order to be consistent with
$\dg M$.  
%
We measure the magnitude of this perturbation with relative entropy. In
%oli22: hiding the label \ell. 
%original:
% particular, for each edge $L = (X,Y, \ell)$, and each $x \in \V(X)$, we measure
%option 1: with words
% particular, for each edge $L$ from $X$ to $Y$, and each $x \in \V(X)$, we measure
%option 2: with the same notation I put in the definition
%joe20
%particular, for each edge $\ed LXY$, and each $x \in \V(X)$, we measure
%the relative entropy from $\bp(x)$ to $\mu(Y \!= \cdot\mid X=x)$, take the
particular, for an edge $\ed LXY$ and $x \in \V(X)$, we measure
the relative entropy from $\bp(x)$ to $\mu(Y \!= \cdot\mid X=x)$, and take the
expectation over $\mu_X$ (that is, the marginal of $\mu$ on $X$). We then sum
over all the edges $L$ in the PDG, weighted by their reliability.


\begin{defn}\label{def:inc}
%oli19: swapping \mu and {\dg M} to shift foucs.
	% The \emph{incompatibility} of a PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ with
	% a joint distribution $\mu$, denoted $\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$, is  
    For a PDG $\dg M$, the \emph{incompatibility} of a
    a joint distribution $\mu$ over $\V(\dg M)$, is given by
    \[
%oli19: removed \pdgvars above, putting ^{\dg M} subscripts here instead.
	\Inc_{\dg M }( \mu) := 
		\!\!\!\!\!\!\sum_{\ed L{X\,}{\,Y} \in \Ed^{\dg M}} \!\!\!\!\!\beta_L^{\dg M} \Ex_{x \sim \mu_{_X}}\!\!
%oli19: no \cdot to make equation fit on one line. The fact that it is a 
% distribution should be clear because both that this is standard notation, and
% because of the definition of KL divergence that follows. 
% \left[\kldiv[\Big]{ \mu(Y\!= \cdot\mid X \sheq x) }{\bp(x) } \right] ,
%oli24: fixing overfull box
% \left[\kldiv[\Big]{ \mu(Y \mid X \sheq x) }{\bp^{\dg M}(x) } \right] , \]
\left[\kldiv[\Big]{ \mu(Y \mid X \sheq x) }{\bp^{\dg M}(x) } \right] , \]
	where $\kldiv{\mu}{\nu} = \sum_{w \in \text{Supp($\mu$)}} \mu(w) \log\frac{\mu(w)}{\nu(w)}$ is the 
	relative entropy from $\nu$ to $\mu$.
%joe17: If we use this at all, it should be defined where it's used,
%not here
%oli20: oops, fixed.
\vfull{
	The \emph{inconsistency of PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$}, denoted $\Inc(\dg M)$, is the minimum possible incompatibility of $\dg M$ with any distribution $\mu$,  
	\[ \Inc(\dg M) = \inf_{ \mu \in \Delta [W_{\cal V}]} \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) . \]
}
\end{defn}

%joe17*: cutting this.  This might be useful if we used it somewhere
%(in which case it should probably go where it's used, not here), but we don't.
%oli20: agreed, updating comment.
\vfull{
    The idea behind this definition of inconsistency is that we want to choose a
    distribution $\mu$ that minimizes the total number of bits required to
    encode all of the relevant conditional marginals. More precisely, fix a
    distribution $\mu$. For each edge $L = (X, Y, \ell) \in \Ed$ and $x \in
    \V(X)$, we are given a code for $Y$ optimized for the distribution $\bp(x)$,
    and asked to transmit data from $\mu(Y\mid x)$; we incur a cost for each bit
    required beyond what we would have used had we used a code optimized for the
    actual distribution $\mu(Y\mid X=x)$. To obtain the cost for $L$, we take a
    weighted average of these costs, where the weight for the value $x$ is the
    probability $\mu_X(x)$. We do this for every edge $L \in \Ed$, summing the
    cost.

    For even more intuition, imagine two agents ($A$ and $B$) with identical
    beliefs described by a PDG $\dg M$ about a set of variables that are in fact
    distributed according to $\mu$. For each edge $L = (X,Y, \ell) \in \Ed^\dg
    M$, values $x,y \in \V(X)$ are chosen according to $\mu_{_{XY}}$ and $x$ is
    given to both agents. 

    At this point, the agents, having the same conditional beliefs, and the same
    information about $Y$, agree on the optimal encoding of the possible values
    of $Y$ as sequences of bits, so that if $y$ were drawn from $\bp(x)$, the
    fewest number of bits would be needed to communicate it in expectation. The
    value of $y$---which is distributed not according to $\bp(x)$, but $\mu(Y
    \mid X=x)$---is now given to agent A. The agents pay a cost equal the number
    of bits needed to encode $y$ according to the agreed-upon optimal code, but
    reimbursed the (smaller) cost that would have been paid, had the agents
    beliefs lined up with the true distribution $\mu$.

    Repeating for each edge and summing the expectations of these costs, we can view
    $\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$ as the total number of \emph{additional} expected
    bits required to communicate $y$ with a code optimized for
    $\bp$ instead of the true conditional distribution   $\mu(Y \mid X=x)$. 

    If $\dg M$ is inconsistent, then there will be a cost no matter what
    distribution $\mu$ is the true distribution. Conversely, if $\dg M$ is
    consistent, then any distribution $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ will have $\Inc_{\dg
    M}( \mu) = 0$.  

	\begin{example}[continues=ex:worldsonly]
	    Recall our simplest example, which directly encodes an entire distribution $p$
	    over the set $W$. In this case, there is only one edge, the expectation is over
	    a single element, and the marginal on $W$ is the entire distribution. Therefore,
	    $\Inc(\dg M; \mu) = \kldiv{\mu}{\mu}$, so the inconsistency is just the
	    information $\mu$ and $p$, so is minimized uniquely when $\mu$ is $p$
	\end{example}
}

%oli22: remove "only" to reclaim my line
$\SD{\dg M}$ and $\Inc_{\dg M}$ distinguish %only
between distributions based on their compatibility with
$\dg M$, but even among distributions that match the
marginals, some more closely match the qualitative structure
of the graph than others.  
\commentout{
    Suppose an agent has a PDG $\dg M$ in mind, and imagines that all sample
    variation in a joint distribution $\mu$ over $\V(\dg M)$ arises as a result
    %joe9*: In the next line, did you mean ``some'' or ``each''? See my
    %next joe9*
    %oli11: Both words are ambiguous because of the sentence structure,
    %but I meant to say that we imagine the distribution is generated by
    %rolling the dice in each link. What we do is clear from the
    %formula. I think this is why I prefer putting the formula before the
    %explanation --- people read the explanation already knowing what
    %you're going to do, and then learn why you do it.
    %joe10: there are reasons to put intuition before the formula, and
    %reasons to put after.  I generally prefer giving a high-level
    %intuition first, and then following up with more intuition after the
    %formula if it's would help                
    of sampling the value of a target variable $Y$ of some edge $\ed LXY$, given the
    value of $X$. If this is the case, one would expect the total amount of
    information required to communicate a sample of $\mu$ to be the same as the
    total amount of the information required to separately encode, for
    each edge $\ed LXY$, the randomness of $Y$ given $X$.

    For an arbitrary PDG and $\mu$, these two quantities will differ; if the amount
    of uncertainty in the distribution is lower than one would expect from the
    edges, the distribution has an \emph{information deficiency}, indicating that there
    are additional correlations between variables that are not captured by the
    graph. The higher the information deficiency, the worse the qualitative fit between
    the PDG and $\mu$.
    %joe9*: Now you lost me.  What is ``surplus uncertainty''? This needs
    %tob e given *much* more intuition.
    On the other hand, if a distribution has surplus uncertainty, using it confers a
    benefit. For instance, a PDG containing only the variable $X$
    %joe9* I strenously object to the use of ``safest'' in the way you've
    %used it below.  What is safe depends on utilities, which we haven't
    %mentioned. 
    %oli11: I think this is false. While to express "safe" in general, you
    %would need a utility function, I claim that there is not *any*
    %utility function that, over the joint space of random variables here,
    %would change this calculus at all (except to make it so that you
                    %don't care).

%think you want to talk about \mu matching \dg M.  Also, in fact, it
%does not match the definition, since it doesn't say what to do with
%parallel edges
%oli13: We already talk about matching in the sentence above.
%oli13: ALso the parallel edges is the reverse of what I'm talking about here.
%How do I people from getting this mixed up? If you think about it carefully.
%With parallel edges (b) > (a) and as we've said, there are additional
%correlations that allow for a more  compact representation. That's the case
%that parallel edges push towards ( and of course the total score is just in
%net). We still need to give intuition for the other case though; here we need
%to say something about the case when (for instance) there are no edges at all.
%joe12: I didn't understand what you wrote above
%   A joint distribution that qualitatively matches $\mu$ will intuitively
%   have as much variation as possible, except where we have claimed that
%   one variable depends on another.
%oli13*: Ok, but we need to impart slightly more detailed intuition instead of
% saying this. I know you don't like entroyp, but given that our formua uses
% entropy (Sorry), and we need to  say something of intermediate formality here
% that gives the right intuition --- we need to say something about variation, 
% or something else that's equivalent with different words. That's the 
% concept we need to communicate here. It doesn't matter if it's undefined, we
% are about to define it. You do a good job explaining it. We'll explain it 
% eve more carefully in the appendix. I promise you nobody at Neurips will care.
% People take so much information theory (and whatever else) for granted; for 
% the full paper, I think we can say enough to make you happy, because I belive
% it really is well-motivated.
%joe12: sometimes less is more.  If you can impart useful intuition.
%oli14: THe reason I keep changing your words in this particular
%section is not 
% because I don't like the way they sound, but because I think they either say
% almost nothing, or they are slightly wrong / misleading. Considering the 
% (perhaps regretably) standard % culture of talking in a cavalier way about
% information, I think I have a bit better sense of how to impart useful
% intuition about entropy.
%I'd *strongly* prefer to say something well in the appendix and nothing
%here rather than saying something not-so-good or unclear here.

%oli16:rewrite 1:
    % A distribution $\mu$  qualitatively matches $G$ well if it is

%intuition.  We said above than an think of edge from X to Y as

%(noisily) computed from $X$ alone.'' If you want to say something about
%non-edges, it should be that there is no edge from X to Y if we can't
%compute X from Y alone.  If you think that's not quite right, then
%it's better to say nothing than to say something which is likely to
%confuse the reader, especially given how we've described the meaning
%of an edge.
%oli17: I don't think that saying that helps bridge the gap between this idea
%and the next one. I am willing to settle with the document in its current
%state. However, if you read these two paragraphs again closely, you will see
%a rather large chasm between the "qualitatively described just by X" bit, and
%the "information requird to draw a sample" bit. We do not explain why they are
%related. We might modify the first part, but we cannot delete it because we
%need to talk about the qualitative nature of a link; I think that changing the
%secong part significantly is an even bigger mistake, as this is the best
%intuition we give for the equation.

%$G$ should be inefficient to describe in every respect except those
%relationships that are encoded by the edges of $G$.  
%oli16:rewrite 3:
% pros: technically accurate
% cons: not the clearest why this is desirable. 
    % We judge a distribution $\mu$ to qualitatively fit $G$ better
    % when the features of an outcome $\mat w \sim \mu$ that follow
    % from the conditional outcomes of $G$ are easy to describe (given
    % $\mu$), and worse when any other features (i.e., those not
    % described by $G$) of $\mat w$ are easy to describe (given
    % $\mu$). 
%oli16:rewrite 4:
% pros: still accurate, more explicit about why it works
% cons: not very eloquent, and might require some of the figures to
% really see why this is the same as the formalism. 
    % Intuitively, a distribution is most likely to have been
    % generated by the edges of $G$ if the information required to
    % specify a the target variables of $G$ directly is no more than
    % the information required to sample separately along the edges of
    % $G$. If $\mu$ makes it easy to describe other aspects of a
    % sample, that $G$ does not articulate, this counts against the
    % match, because we imagine that $G$ would have included these
    % edges if they were easy to communicate qualitatively. 
%oli13: This "anything" is intentionally vague. We cannot clarify this with 
% just the variables it says nothing about, because cycles are possible. 
%joe12*: NO!  I don't know what it means, and I won't accept vagueness
%here.  It's better to cut it!  I need to go now; I'll come back to

%joe10: I'm not ure where there ``are known'' is coming from
%oli12: I don't think this is strictly necessary, but it could be useful
% clarification. It seems you (and sometimes I) sometimes get
% mixed up about what exactly this information means.
% The point is that it's the information needed to specify
% the outcome if you already know it is drawn from \mu. 
%joe11: the sentence with ``are known'' doesn't even parse.  Let's
%just leave it.
%oli13: Oops, this parses though (I don't think the "we thus" buys us anything except fluff):
%joe13: whether or not \mu is known is irrelevant!  Why empahsize it
%For a fixed $G$ and known $\mu$, contrast the amount
%oli15: very false. \mu has to be common knowledge! I won't change
%joe14: knowledge has nothing to do with anything here!  There are no
%agents in the picture in this definition.
%oli16: We're now heavily leaning on the term "description", which I argue
% is effectively knowledge. As a technical matter, the way we
% calculate the length of this  
% description assumes that the distribution \mu is known to both the
% sender and reiever of the description.
%joe15: I don't see why.  A calculation is a mathematical expression.
%At best you can say that they way you *use* the result of the calculation is
%meaningful only if something is common knowledge,  but that would
%depend on the usage.   The calculation itself does not depend on
%knowledge. There is no sender and receiver anywhere in our formalism.
%oli17: Ok no more agentive terminology. For the  "description" metaphor to make
%sense, it's necessary that the description gets to exploit the distribution.
%Therefore both the construction of the description, and the interpretation of
%the description, must depend on \mu. Are we now on the same page?
%joe16: I'm afraid not.  I'm not sure what you mean by ``the
%interpretation of the description'' and how ``the construction of the
%desription'' differs from ``the description''.  I'm happy to agree

%Moreover, this is giving you an excuse not to do what you and I both

%oli22: fixed the (i)/(a) mismatch. I'm doing this because I still think it's
% incredibly important to get this right. I know you're furstrated but I'm
% totally convinced we're not doing this justice. In some cases what you've
% written is wrong. I can't just leave it like this.
	%According to $G$, \ref{item:localinfo} should be small (it would be
	%zero were it not for the allowance for noise),

%oli22: I've merged your version (under "old version below:" a few hudred lines
% down), with mine (immediately above), to produce the following:
%joe20*: Cut; I still don't understand this.  Why should (b) be small
%according to G?  G has nothing to say about (b).  More importantly,
%WE AGREED THAT YOU WOULDN'T DO THIS.  This is a waste of my time and yours.
%According to $G$, knowledge of $\mu$ and the source variables $X$ should be
%sufficient to compute the target variables $Y$, and so \ref{item:localinfo}
%should be small. 
%oli22: cut again; I still think this is lazy b/c (b) is not expanded, and misleading
% because it's only in expectation, and  "description of the world" isn't accurate.

%joe18: Why did you cut this line?  I thought it was useful for the reader
%oli21: it seems like a weaker restatement of the definition of (a) without expanding (b) to give any insight. I was hoping I could replace it with a clear example of where it intuitively feels obvious that the two should be the same.

	 % When these two quantities are equal, a specification of (b) has

%oli21: reinstated with clarification; this is a more technically accurate

a specification of (b) has
 exactly the same length as a full desciption of the world. 
%joe18*: I couldn't parse the next sentence.   I think you mean to be
%talking about distributions that are point masses, but why focus on them?
%oli21: Yeah, by degenerate I mean point masses. The intent was to give a clear
% example of where the information deficiency is zero. Somehow it seems 
% geometrically relevant that the term goes to zero on the vertices of the simplex.
% --- any individual world, regarded as a distribution, has no info deficiency.
%oli20:
%For degenerate distribution $\mu$, every variable is known zero
%further information, (a) = (b) = 0, and there is no information
%deficiency. 
%joe10: misplaced  
%In particular, this is true if
%$\mu$ is a degenerate distribution, in which case the agent, who knows
%$\mu$, requires no descriptions at all.  
%
%If (b) $>$ (a), then there are extra correlations in $\mu$ that are
% If (b) $>$ (a), then there are dependencies suggested by $G$ that are
% not present in $\mu$
If \ref{item:localinfo} $>$ \ref{item:globalinfo}, then there are
correlations in $\mu$ that allow for a more compact representation
than $G$ provides. 
% The larger the difference, the more information is needed to determine
% targets $Y$ beyond their sources $X$ (which according to $G$ should be
% sufficient to compute them)
%joe18*: I found this hard to follow, so rewrote slightly.   But, more
%importantly, I'm really confused.  I would have thought that if (b) > (a)
%then the information given in G might be enough to determine \mu, 
	%oli20: In retrospect I may have writen this in a misleading way.
	% It is true (and basically just a restatement of the defns of a and b)
	% that if (b) > (a), and if the bits in (b) were used more intelligently,
	% the number of bits used for (b) could determine an outcome drawn from \mu.
	% However, it is NOT true that the data of (b) determines (a). It could be
	% that there are just a ton of parallel edges which make (b) expensive
	% without saying anything about the rest of the distribution. Do not take
	% this as saying something about G; recall that for the purposes of this
	% definition, we take G as truth, and evaluate the quality of \mu relative
	% to it. Many parallel edges in G, amounts to an assertion that for \mu to be 
	% any good, it must be such that that Y is almost entirely determined by knowing X.
	%(intuitively: you're willing to compute it in all these different ways, which agree.)
	% 
%joe18*[continued]:... but it can be described more compactly.  You're suggesting
% that it's not enough, which would be the case if (a) > (b), not if (b) > (a).  
%oli21*:
% The quantity (b) is the total amount of information REQUIRED (in expectation),
% to determine Y, given the value of X. So if (b) is large, this is an intuitive
% violation  of G's qualitative assertion that Y can be computed from X --- 
%  --- because if this were the case, then not very much information is required
% to determine Y if X is known. 
%
% I think what you wrote is misleading for two reasons:
% (1) we're not using the conditional probabilities associated to edges; we're 
% only using data of \mu, and
%joe19*: I don't understand this point.  We looing at the entropy of
%the conditional probability determined by \mu relative to the
%conditional probability associated with the edge.
%oli22*: We're NOT doing that here! (though that is what we do for Inc.)
% I keep rephrasing it in part to minimize the probability that readers
% interpret it this way. We're looking at the conditional probability 
% determined by $\mu$ on every edge, relative to the global probability of $\mu$.
% *The cpds associated to the edges do not enter the calculation*.
% (2) it doesn't mention the value of the source X, which is critical. 
%joe19: I don't think this is a problem; we said ``conditional
%probabilities associated with the edge X -> Y.
%joe19: reverted back
%oli22: This is technically wrong still. I've altered my version 
% below to address the point you brought up.
% old version below:
%joe20*: I don't see why it's technically wrong.  We can discuss it
%AFTER THE DEADLINE
% The larger the difference, the more information is needed to determine
	% targets $Y$ beyond the conditional probabilities associated with the
	% edges $X \rightarrow Y$ leading to $Y$
	% (which according to $G$ should be sufficient to compute them)
%.
%oli21: Below is a technically accurate version which is quite hard to parse,
% for the reading I intended ---  but feel free to ignore if you like something
% along the lines of my rewrite, which is a little different.
%      The larger the difference, the more the additional information needed (in
% expectation) to determine, for each link from $X$ to $Y$, (in a world $\mat
% w\sim \mu$, knowing $\mu$, but not $\mat w$) the value of $Y$ ($\mat w_Y$)
% already knowing the value of $X$  ($\mat w_X$), which according to $G$ should be
% sufficient to compute $Y$ with some uncertainty,  exceeds the total amount
% uncertainty there is to be had in $\mu$ ($\H(\mu)$).  
%oli21: I've rewritten this sentence probably 50 times. I think
%finally found something 
% that's not too long and ties together the metaphrs a little better 
%joe19*: I think that this was a TERRIBLE use of your time, and
%something I explicitly asked you not to do.  Despite your concerns, I
%strongly prefer the original version; I don't know what ''noise along
%G'' means. I undid all your changes.  Please don't spend time on this now.
%oli22: that's fair. one more attempt...
%jeo20: reverting back.  It seems to me that what you wrote is going
%the wrong way in any case.  If (b) > (a), this says that \mu gives a
%more compact description that G does, so I find what you wrote really
%confusing.  I kept the last phrase
The larger the difference,  the more information is needed to determine
targets $Y$ beyond the conditional probabilities associated with the
edges $X \rightarrow Y$ leading to $Y$
(which according to $G$ should be sufficient to compute them), 
%%the shorter $\mu$ falls in acounting for all of its uncertainty along each edge of $G$ (as in \ref{item:localinfo}),
% the shorter $\mu$ falls in acounting for all of its noise along $G$,
% the more $\mu$'s correlations undermine the qualitative picture painted by $G$,
% the more such correlations undermine a view of \cref{item:locclinfo} as noise,
% the less reasonable it is to view \cref{item:localinfo} as noise, 
% the more the noise along $G$ exceeds all noise in the system, 
% the more the variation that $G$ attributes to noise exceeds the total entropy in the system, 
% the more additional information beyond a of each edge target given its source exceeds the information required to determine a sample drawn from $\mu$,
%
%oli22: these lines were in the previous version and did not get reverted.
%and so the greater the $G$-information deficiency of $\mu$, 
and the poorer the qualitative fit of $\mu$ to $G$.
%oli21: third hand
% On the other hand, 
Finally,
if \ref{item:globalinfo} $>$ \ref{item:localinfo}, then 
%oli21: (new line) add the clause for intuition on this half also
%joe19: I don't understand the clause that you added; I cut it.

%joe18: cut this; I don't think it helps.  I prefer what we had
%before.  More importantly, I think what we had before will be more
%meaningful to more readers.
%oli21: Ok I agree now.
%---what might be called a $G$-information excess.

% $\mu$ now has a $G$-information \emph{surplus}.
%joe11*: I don't like this, and don't really understand it.  Why are
%we suddenly making things  unspecified by G constants.  I cut it.
%joe13* :I don't understand why this should be true, and don't
%understand why yu want ot make things a contsnt.  Again, I feel
%strongly that this hurts far more than it helps.
%oli15*: You wanted to know what zero means. I'm motivating negative
%numbers. In any case we still need the punchline. partially
%reinstated. 
%joe14*: I still don't understand.  What does it mean to fix things
%that are unkonwn, and why should we want to do this?  If you can't
%explain this better, then I feel strongly we should cut the next line.
%oli16: A distribution fixes something that is unknown, if there's a
%feature that has no presence in $G$, and according to $\mu$ this
%feature is a constant.
%joe15: I simply did not understand the sentence above at all.  I
%wrote a whole book on uncertainty.  I'm considered an expert in the
%area, yet I find the language in your preceding sentence completely
%mysterious.  I feel like we're speaking different languages.  
%We don't want to fix things that are unknown. You've got it backwards: I'm
%saying that such a distribution DOES in fact match all of the independencies of
%$G$, so it would not be fair to ding it. But another distribution that did all
%of this and also made these unknown features in $G$ also difficult to describe
%--- this distribution deserves extra credit.
%Such a $\mu$ is arguably a \emph{better} fit to $G$, than a
    % Such a $\mu$ is arguably a \emph{better} fit to $G$ than a
    % distribution that that merely obeys the dependencies (and fixes things
    % that are unknown) [[REWRITE]]. 
%oli16:rewrite.
%joe15*: I give up.  I don't understand this at all, so it clearly is
%not helping my intuition.  I have no clue why we're comparing to a
%distribution that just exhibits the dependence structure of G (which
%I assume means that \mu has all the conditional independencies
%expressed by the edges of G.  Where did that come from?  I have no
%idea what it means for G to to articular features of an outcome.  My
%best guess is that you're trying to say something about non-edges,
%but that's a guess.
%oli17: IDef has two effects:
% (Here "wherever" means for every region of the info diagram, i.e., subset
% of variables that excludes some other subset.)
% (1) to give a max-entropy result wherever G does not specify something
% (think: no edges, or a cycle that allows multiple solutions), and 
% (2) to give a min-entropy result whenever it is over-specified. For regions
% with exactly 2 overlapping variables, this amounts to a statement of
% independence.
%joe16: This may be true; I don't understand IDef well enough.  I
%suspect it's not true, but just describes extreme cases.  In any case, it
%is definitely *not* what we should be writing here.  It's far too
%dependent on the details of this scoring function, and doesn't get at
%the essence of what we hope the scoring function is trying to do.
%You keep saying ``the scoring function does the right thing''.  What
%we should be saying here is what the ``right thing'' is, not
%describing what the scoring function does.
%oli17 Examples. In [X -> Y], X is qualitatively under-specified, and in 
% [ X <-> Y ], the mutual data between X and Y is qualitatively under-specified.
% On the other hand, in [X <- 1 -> Y], the area shared in both X and Y is
% over-specified (as it is specified by both edges), and so the resulting IDef
% term penalizes mutual information, giving a min-entropy result.
%
%oli17: now, with regard to the above, I'm trying to hint at (1). I'm trying to 
% that if G has nothing to say about a variable Z (maybe no edges to Z), or about the mutual information between X and Y (maybe there's a cycle, with many soultions), then $\mu$ gets bonus points for not being certain about it. 
%
%oli17: I can articulate this more clearly with the information diagrams---which I think
% I am going to write in a separate document for you, and not press here right now.
%joe16: I will say again that this discussion doesn't belong at this
%point in the paper (and is probably best saved for a meeting).  
%joe15:  I view the next sentence as a significant net
%negative.  The likelihood that it will hep a reader are far lower
%than the likelihood that it will confuse the reader.  I'm cutting it.
%oli17*: If we do not at least state the polarity, there is another big gap
% in our story here---why do we even bother saying this sentence? It doesn't 
% even lead to a vague intuition about IDef. We need to discuss this in person.
%joe16: Yes; let's discuss it in person

}
%joe10: \end{commentout} followed by my rewrite
%oli21: adding a backslash to each H in this section so it is typeset correctly
% as an operator.
%joe19: This was not a good use of your time!
Suppose that $\dg M$ has two nodes, $X$ and $Y$.  If $\dg M$ has no edges, the
$\IDef{\dg M}(\mu) = - \H(\mu)$. There is no information required to specify, for
each edge in ${\dg M}$ from $X$ to $Y$, the value ${\mat w}_Y$ given ${\mat
w}_X$, since there are no edges. Since we view smaller numbers as representing a
better fit, $\IDef{\dg M}$ in this case will prefer the distribution that
maximizes entropy. If $\dg M$ has one edge from $X$ to $Y$, then since $\H(\mu) =
\H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) + \H_\mu(X)$
%oli21: this is not worth saying. My guess is over 99% of the people
%who  get this far into the paper will know this, there's no vagueness, 
% and it feels condescending to  point it out.
%joe19: undid; I guess that I'm in the remaining 1%
by the well known \emph{entropy chain rule} \cite{mackay2003information},
$\IDef{\dg   M}(\mu) = -\H_{\mu}(X)$. Intuitively,
while knowing the conditional probability $\mu(Y \mid X)$ is helpful, to
completely specify $\mu$ we also need $\mu(X)$. Thus, in this case, $\IDef{\dg
M}$ prefers distributions that maximize the entropy of the marginal
on $X$. 
If $\dg M$ has sufficiently many parallel edges
% What I don't like about "sufficiently many" is that we're varying the graph
% while keeping $\mu$ constant, and so $\H > 0$ is not particularly meaningful.
% I'm adding an edge 1 -> X so that this is correct and has the right emphasis.
%joe13*: Aargh!! You took a clean story with two nodes, and muddled it
%by adding a third node.  This is not helpful.  I reverted back.  
% an edge $1 \to X$, and also 
%oli15* AAhh This node doesn't even change the joint space! It's also
%not and  emphasizes the wrong things
%joe14*: but from a reader's perspective, it does (and you've never
%said that the node 1 doesn't count for the sample space.  If that's
%the cse, you need to say that somewhere!
%oli16*: I'm not even treating it like a special variable. It just has
%one value, so the sample space is naturally isomorphic to the sample
%space that does not include it.
%joe15: I will repeat.  These are things you haven't discussed.  Why
%complicated the reader's likfe by introducing it?
%oli17: another possibility: define IDef for hyper-graphs. It's more intuitive,
% we'll be able to use examples like this directly, and it will immediately
% apply to other directed graphical models.
%joe16: NO!!!  After saying that we're not going to deal with
%hypergraphs, we shouldn't bring them in now.
%oli16: When I last looked at this I didn't re-perform the changes you made here
%due to time pressure, but I still think the emphasis on a fixed \mu and a
%changing M is much less clear than the reverse. Besides, wasn't that our
%rationale for changing IDef to have M as a subscript? You're emphasizing this,
%and the number zero, both of which you have repeatedly told me make no sense. I
%do not understand why you wrote the example this way. 
 %oli14: fix spacing
 %more than one parallel edge
%joe13: this wasnn't worth the effort; I really don't want to
%introduce this notation out of the blue
 % $X \substack{\to\\[-1em]\to} Y$
 from $X$ to $Y$
%oli13:
%joe13: reverted
 and $\H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) > 0$ 
%while $H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) > 0$ 
%oli12: this is reversed for H, but the correct intuition for each edge.
% Because of the context, I'm assuming you meant the former and changing it.
% (so knowing $X$ tells you something about $Y$),
(so that $Y$ is not totally determined by $X$)
then we have $\IDef{\dg M}(\mu) > 0$, because the redundant edges add no
information, but there is still a cost to specifying them.
In this case, $\IDef{\dg M}$ prefers distributions that make $Y$ a
deterministic function of $X$ will maximizing the entropy of the
marginal on $X$.
Finally, if ${\dg M}$ has an edge from $X$ to $Y$ and another from $Y$
to $X$, then a distribution $\mu$ minimizes $\IDef{\dg M}$ when 
% $X$ and $Y$ depend on each other 
%joe11: I don't like ``have randomness'', and it's unneessary.  I
%don't see why ``vary together'' is better than ``depend on each
%other'', but I'll leave it
%$X$ and $Y$ both individually have randomness, but vary together
$X$ and $Y$  vary together (so that $\H_\mu(Y \mid X) = \H_\mu(X \mid Y) = 0$)
while maximizing $\H(\mu)$, for example, by taking $\mu(0,0)
= \mu(1,1) = 1/2$.

$\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$ and $\IDef{\dg M}(\mu)$ give us two measures
of compatibility between ${\dg M}$ and a distribution $\mu$.
We take the score of interest to be their sum, with the tradeoff
controlled by a parameter $\gamma \ge 0$:

\begin{equation}
  	  \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu)
%joe8*: your formullation does not let us ignore Inc.  I don't see why
%we shouldn't allow ignoring Inc

%oli10: This is a good point. I am actually sympathetic to this framing of it, 
% Howeer, it's not mathematically necessary becasue we already have
% scaling parameters for each $\beta$.  
% I actually now buy that convex combinations are the "right" thing to
% do, but it involves adding two extra scalar parameters that change
      % nothing to get the units right.
%joe9: I don't see why; let's discuss.          
% In the full paper I would prefer to do this properly as a convex combination.
%oli10: Because of our discussion and my rewrite above, I am reverting this. 
% I'm not trying to be stubborn though; my preference has weakened,
%and if you care you should change it back. Just be aware that the
%factor graph section will require a few factors of 1/(1-\gamma).  
%joe9*: OK; let's leave it as is  for the abstract; we have better
%things to focus on.  But since it seems that we agree that the convex
%combination is ``right'', let's do that for the full paper.
	  % := (1-\gamma) \Inc(\dg M,\mu) + \gamma \extrainfo\mu
	 := \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) + \gamma \IDef{\dg M}(\mu)  \label{eqn:full-score}
\end{equation}

The following just makes precise that the scoring semantics generalizes the first semantics.

\begthm{prop}{prop:sd-is-zeroset}
% For all PDGs $\dg M$, we have that $\SD{\dg M}=\{\mu : \bbr{\dg M}_0(\mu) = 0\}$.

	all $\dg M$.
\end{prop}
          
While we focus on this particular scoring function in the paper, 
in part because
%oli19
% it leads to interesting results and
% has deep connections to the free energy of a factor graph \cite{KF09},
%joe17: what does it mean that an anlogy is common in a model?  You

it has deep connections to the free energy of a factor graph \cite{KF09},
other scoring functions may well end up being of interest. 
%oli19*: You may appreciate this
%joe17*: I might appreciate it if I understood it.  is there a space
%of possible divergence functions?  If so, this needs to be explained
%*much better* before it can be included.  Specifically, you have to
%describe what the space is, and give a reference.  I cut it for now.
%oli20*: a divergence D on a space X := any D satisfying  { D(x,y) = 0
%iff x=y }.
%joe18: This may be a standad definition, but I've never seen it
%before.  You certainly can't assume that the reader knows it.
% To get the BN theorem, we only need Inc to be such that a distribution minimizing
% it is compatible with all CPTs.  (Please follow up if you still want a reference.)
%
%oli21: what do you think of adding the below with that definition?
%joe19: Please don't add it.   If you did, you would have to explain
%divergence.  Moreover, this is just one result that we have.
%In fact, \Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs} would follow from \emph{any} choice
%of divergence, so the fact that PDGs extend Bayesian Network semantics
%does not hinge on this choice. 
        
%oli8: deleted. Higher value to talk about trade-off parameter
%	For $\gamma = 0$, the only thing that matters is consistency, as $\mathcal U_0 = \Inc$.
%joe7: I have no idea of what ``regularization strength'' means.
%The trade-off parameter $\gamma$ can be seen as a regularization strength,
%                trading off quantitative fit for
                %        qualitative accuracy.
%joe7**: why do we focus on this case?  We need to motivate this.
%joe8: I cut this from here: it's the wrong place.
%        In this paper, we focus on the case
%        where $\gamma$ is small, making $\Inc$ the more important term. 
%joe4*: cut; this is false, unless you're allowing infinitesimals.
%Why complicate things?
%	For $\gamma>0$ but arbitrarily small, the preference for
%        consistency dominates, and extra information is used only to
%        break ties. If an agent is very certain that their cpds are
%        well-informed, which we will call the `low ambient
        %        uncertainty' case, this may be appropriate.
        %joe4*: I don't understand this intuition, Oliver.  It needs to
        %be explained better.  In what way do you get more ``safety''
        %if \gamma is larger?

\commentout{
	\begin{example}
		Consider the PDG with variables $\sf 1$ and $X$, and two distributions $p, q$ on $X$, that only overlap with $\epsilon$ mass.
		\todo{This works out nicely but I actually don't think this can be done without eliding a row of a cpd (which I've been calling sub-stochasticity). This is the one discussed in meeting, where two experts disagree on their except for $\epsilon$ overlap.}
	\end{example}


    $\mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M, p)$ can be thought of as the energy state of
            a distribution (larger numbers indicate a worse fit) and can
            be anywhere between $-\infty$ and $\infty$.
            To get a semantics in the style of \cite{halpern2015weighted},
            we transform it so that it is non-negative and larger scores
            are better (making it distribution-like, by analogy to a
            Boltzmann distribution) and normalize so that the lowest
            energy distributions get weight 1. We introduce a scaling
            parameter $k > 0$ (the corresponding inverse temperature)
           which does not affect the rankings of distributions. 
    %joe4*: I would like to add a sentence relating this to Halpern and
    %Leung, but I don't undrestand the scaling parameter at all.   Why
    %complicate matters. We can just take it to be 1.
           \[ W^k_\gamma(\dg M, \mu) := \exp\Big(  -k \Big\{\mathcal U_{\gamma}(\dg M,\mu)- \inf_{\mu'} \mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M,\mu')\Big\} \Big).\]
    Now 
    $W^k_\gamma(\mu) \in  [0,1]$, for all $k$, and hence acts like a weight in the sense of  Halpern and Leung \citeyear{halpern2015weighted}.
    For now, we set $k=1$, but note that $k$ does not affect the ranking of distributions of scores according to $W^k_\gamma(\dg M, -)$, and so $\arg\max_{\mu'} W^k_\gamma(\dg M, \mu')  = \arg\min_{\mu'} \mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M,\mu')$ is independent of $k$. 
    %
    $W_\gamma$ and $\mathcal U_\gamma$ carry roughly equivalent information aside from the normalization, but the latter is slightly more useful and will play a larger role in our analysis, and so we notationally use this as our second semantics: $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) := \mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M, \mu)$.

	We now offer generalizations of some results found in in

        \Cref{def:cont-inconsist} is the continuous version of

	As a result of \Cref{cor:u-convex}, $\bbr{M}$ is a quasiconvex function

\commentout{
	The semantics given in \Cref{sec:set-of-distribution-semantics} does not allow us to express independencies very effectively.
	For instance, in \Cref{ex:smoking}, to fully get the joint
        representation given by the BN, we also need to somehow assume
        that $SC \CI S \mid PS$. This is possible to do explicitly
        with an extra arrow meaningless arrow, but this solution doe
        not scale well, looks like it dependence (the opposite of our
        intention), and clutters the diagram.  
	We now show that by applying the principal of maximum entropy, we can recover all of a BN's independence assumptions at once. This should make intuitive sense: maximizing entropy tend to `make things as independent as possible'. 
	Those familiar with the view of graphical models as separable exponential families may have even seen a similar result in an undirected setting \cite[e.g..][pp. 37-39]{wainwright2008graphical}. 
	We proceed with the theorem, and discuss some consequences below.
}

\subsection{PDGs As Unique Distributions}\label{sec:uniq-dist-semantics}

Finally, we provide an interpretation of a PDG as a probability distribution.
Before we provide this semantics, we stress that this distribution does
\emph{not} capture all of the important information in the PDG---for example, a
PDG can represent inconsistent knowledge states.  Still, by giving a
distribution, we enable comparisons with other graphical models% 
%oli24:
% what is "it"? 
%. It also shows that PDGS are 
%joe22
%, and reveal PDGs to be
, and show that PDGs are
a surprisingly flexible tool for specifying distributions.  
The idea is to select the distributions with the best score. 
We thus define 
\begin{equation}
	\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^* = \argmin_{\mu \in \Delta\V(\dg M)} \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu).
\end{equation}   

In general, $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ does not give a unique distribution.  But if
$\gamma$ is sufficiently small, then it does:

\begthm{prop}{prop:sem3}
	If $\dg M$ is a PDG and $0 < \gamma \leq \min_L \beta_L^{\dg M}$, then
	$\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ is a singleton. 
\end{prop}

In this paper, we are interested in the case where $\gamma$ is small;
this amounts to emphasizing the accuracy of the probability
distribution as a description of probabilistic information,
%joe20: IDef does not talk directly about the independence structre.  
%rather than the independence structure of the PDG%.
rather than the graphical structure of the PDG.  
%oli22: poorly worded.
% This is what was going on in all the examples in the introduction.
%joe20: I'm not sure what the ``this'' is, nor what ability you're
%talking about (since the previous lines don't talkabout ability).  I
%tried to put what you meant
%, an ability we exploited often in the introduction.
%oli24: cutting this because we're out of space
% In the examples, that we considered in the introduction, our focus was
% the probability, so this choice is compatible with the way we
% presented the examples.
This motivates us to consider
what happens as $\gamma$ goes to 0.  If $S_\gamma$ is a set of
probability distributions for all $\gamma \in [0,1]$, we define $\lim_{\gamma
\rightarrow 0} S_\gamma$ to consist of all distributions $\mu$ such that there
is a sequence $(\gamma_i, \mu_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}$ with $\gamma_i \to 0$ and
$\mu_i \to \mu$ such that $\mu_i \in S_{\gamma_i}$ for all $i$. 
It can be further shown that 

\begthm{prop}{prop:limit-uniq}
    For all $\dg M$, $\lim_{\gamma\to0}\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ is a singleton.
\end{prop}
%
Let $\bbr{{\dg M}}^*$ be the unique element of $\smash{\lim\limits_{\gamma
	\rightarrow 0}} \bbr{{\dg M}}_\gamma^*$. 
%
%oli9: this prop is false for now
\commentout{
	There is a unique such distribution because, as we now
	show, the score is strongly convex
	which can be found efficiently \cite{strongconvexopt}.

		(\Cref{prop:neg-ent-convex}), so $- \gamma \H(\mu)$ is $\gamma$-strongly convex.

        convex functions must be $\gamma$-strongly convex.

	\subsection{Recovering Other Semantics As Special Cases of Distribution Scores}

	We have just seen that $\gamma >0$, $\mathcal U_\gamma$ has a unique minimum,
        $\UD{\dg M}$. By increasing $k$ in $W^k_\gamma$, the weights of any distribution that is not optimal go to zero. Therefore, taking a limit as $k \to \infty$, we see that $W^k_\gamma$ converges to the weighted
        distribution that puts weight 1 on $\UD{\dg M}$ and weight 0 on all
                        other distributions, as shown below:
%joe3*: I have no idea why this should put weight 1 on a single
%distribution.  I'm lost!  I think we should just give a third
%semantics that amounts to picking the distribution of higest weight, 
%after stating a theorem that says that there always is one.  (Your
%results on convexity will be used in the proof of the theorem, but
%don't need to be stated separately.
%oli3*: I'm just using the standard trick to achieve the maximum without taking 
% a supremum. A supremum is not continuous, but we can get it for these strongly
% convex spaces by taking the associated temperature of the Boltzmann distribution to
% zero.  We're just doing this one level up, for the weighted distributions...
%oli4: I've made a bunch of changes so it's more readable. It still probably won't make it into the short paper, but I think it is useful intuition and verification for the naturality of the semantics.

\vleftovers{
	\subsection{As Probabilisitic Programs}\label{sec:prog-semantics}
	
	One final way of viewing PDGs is as a set of probabilistic programs, corresponding to the edges. 
	Conditional distributions can be thought of as probabilistic programs. As a result, we can compose and run them: paths from $A$ to $B$ correspond to noisy estimates of $B$ from $A$.
	
	Specifically, if $f(b \mid a) : \mathcal V_A \to \Delta \mathcal V_B$ and $g(c \mid b) : \mathcal V_B \to \Delta \mathcal V_C$ are conditional distributions, then the probabilistic composition $g\circ f : \mathcal V_A \to \Delta\mathcal V_C$ is
	\begin{align*}
		(g\circ  f) (c \mid a) :=  \sum_{b \in \mathcal V B}\!\! f (b \mid a)\ g(c \mid b)
	\end{align*}
	
	This can be recognized as a matrix multiplication $f$ and $g$ regarded as sub-stochastic matrices.
	Thinking about graphical models this way makes thinking about chains of reasoning simpler, gives us a way out of storing probability tables, and suggests additional applications.
	
	More formally, we can define
	\[ \bbr{M}_\lambda = \left\{
			\begin{aligned}
				 \text{paths } p = N_0 \xrightarrow{p^1} N_1 \xrightarrow{p^2}\cdots\xrightarrow{p^n}N_n \\
				 \text{such that } (N_{i-1}, N_i, p^i) \in \Ed^\dg M
			\end{aligned}
		\right\} \]
	
	\begin{example}
		Composition of arrows in a tables in chain is simply an easy case of variable elimination. 
		
		\[
			\scalebox{0.8}{
			\begin{tikzcd}[dpad, ampersand replacement=\&]
				A \ar[r]\& C
			\end{tikzcd}\hspace{3em}
			\begin{tikzcd}[dpad, ampersand replacement=\&]
				A \ar[r]\& B \ar[r] \& C
			\end{tikzcd}}
		\]	

		Conversely, factorization of a table $A \to C$ into tables $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ (i.e., a stochastic matrix factorization) corresponds to splitting a program into two steps, and the data necessary to describe it will be smaller if $|B|$ is small.
	\end{example}	
	
	% It also has not escaped us that PDGs have a particularly nice description in categorical terms, which we do not pursue further here.
	
	Furthermore, thinking about the mental state of an agent as a collection of programs you could run from any concept gives our first natural interpretation of a sub-distribution (more in \Cref{sec:full-model}): probability mass assigned to $\none$ by a edge $p$ has not terminated yet (if at all). 
	Even given infinite time, some paths in $\bbr{\dg M}_\lambda$ may be infinite.
	
	\begin{defn}
		A PDG $\dg M$ is \emph{strongly consistent} if every collection of paths $P \subseteq \bbr{\dg M}_\lambda$ is compatible, in that 
		$$\bigcap_{p \in P}\ \SD*{\vphantom{\Big|}p^0\circ \cdots\circ p^k} \neq \varnothing$$
	\end{defn}

	\begin{example}
		Bayesian Networks and conditional Bayesian Networks are strongly consistent.
	\end{example}

	\begin{prop}
%		$ \text{strongly consistent}  \subsetneq \quad 
%		\text{strictly consistent}  \subsetneq  \text{consistent} $
		Any PDG $M$ that is strongly consistent is also consistent, but some strongly consistent PDGs are not strictly consistent.

    %I think provides useful historical background, explains why the

    To do without the independence assumptions, one might hope

    	In response, some \cite{williamson2001foundations}\cite{holmes2001independence} have added alternate constraints of a causal flavor, which are perhaps smaller and more palatable than the full set of conditional independencies.  Williamson, for instance, introduces what he calls the \emph{principle of causal irrelevance}--- that extending a BN with variables $\{C_i\}$ with children $\{D_j\}$ where no $C_i$ depends on a $D_j$, restricts to the same distribution as the original.  However, these constraints are also overkill: by merely maximizing entropy one can already get the BN distribution for rooted trees, disconnected graphs, and even graphs that have nodes with multiple incoming edges, so long as every row in each such target node's cpd has the same entropy---none of which are reflected as a weakening of assumptions in a Williamson's principle of causal irrelevance.

    %for the counterfactual nature of the cpd?  For that matter, what's
    %counterfactult about it?
    %oli6: This is the motivation for the extra information. We
    %acknowledge that a cpd 
    % results in a distribution at its target, whose entropy depends on
    % the distribution at its 
    % source. Therefore, the cpd results in a different constraint,
    % depending on what the distirbution 
    % at the source is (the cpd counterfactually contains information
    % about the distribution at $Y$, even if the distribution at X were to
    % be completely different). In minimizing the information we know
    % about the distribution, we have to control for the fact that cpds
    % have this property, making them very unlike the standard constraints
    % that are used (e.g., for exponential families). The resulting
            % correction gives us the extra information.
    %joe6*: If you want to keep this, you need to slow down.  Look at a BN
    %of the form X -> Y and point out that the cpd for X gives us the
    %actual distribution on X, but the cpd lets us detemine the marginal
    %probabilty of Y for all distributions on X.  In that sense, its

    %oli16: does it not make sense to you to say "these two functions
    %    are the same, so in particular, their minima are the same?" 
%joe15: what you wrote below is certainly a logical consequence of
%what you wrote above, but it's not a special case.   I would not say
%(in English) ``in particular, their minima are the same''.   I would
%say ``and so their minima are the same''.  We're arguing about
%English here, not mathematics.
    %oli16: whether or not this is an obvious special case might depend on your 
    % representation of the function (it's natural to represent a convex
    % function as a taylor expansion around its critical points, for instance).
        %    In particular, $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}^* = \Pr_{\cal B}$.
and thus $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}^* = \Pr_{\cal B}$.    
\end{theorem}
%oli24: added discussion 
\Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs} is quite robust to parameter choices: it holds for every
weight vector $\beta$ and all $\gamma > 0$. However, it does lean heavily on
our assumption that $\alpha = \mathbf 1$, making it our only result
that does not 
have a natural analog for general $\alpha$.
% In proving \cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs}, 
% we show that $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B}}$ measures the extent to which the independencies
% are violated, which requires $\alpha = \mathbf 1$.

%oli11: For the full paper, once we add restriction & combination, add the following result for conditional BNs.
%joe10*: If we include this, we'll need a *much* better story.  The
%goal is not to overwhelm the reader with theorems, but to tell a
%story.  My guess is that if this belongs anywhere, it belongs in a
%section on  modularity, where we have a more general discussion of
%modularity   This will be an example there.
%joe17*: See my comment above
%oli20: oops, agreed.

    \begin{theorem}
    If $\mathcal B_1, \mathcal B_2, \ldots$ are a conditional Bayesian

\commentout{
    %joe4*: I don't understand the corollary (or even the notation)
	%oli5: I've introduced all of the notation, but I can explain
	%it better. This is the more powerful version of the theorem,
	%and in my opinion, is the real payout of this appraoch: not
	%only is it true for some settings of the parameters, but you
	%get th BN distribution out for ALMOST EVERY setting of the
	%parameters. 
    \begin{coro}
		Let $\cal B$ be a BN. For any $\gamma > 0$, and vector of positive numbers $\vec \beta > \vec 0$, 
		\[ \UD[\Big]{\PDGof{\mathcal B}, \vec{1}, \vec
                  \beta}_\gamma = \Pr\nolimits_{\cal B} \]
%oli5: added. I did this because you say you don't understand the
%statement above, but I have all of this explanation below as well. We
                %should probably remove one of the two.
%joe5: I didn't read this; I don't want to think about \alpha yet (and
%I still don't understand it).                  
		That is, so long as we take each $\alpha_L = 1$, the
                distribution defined by the cpds of $\PDGof{\mathcal
                B}$ with \emph{any weights} is precisely the one given
                by $\cal B$. 
	\end{coro}
	The corollary extends \Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs} through the other two semantics, showing that the result is not sensitive to the additional parameters ($\beta, \gamma$), and works for the default value of $\alpha = 1$.
	This is true for PDGs which are structurally just subsets of BNs, where every node has at most one incoming edge. In such a structure, every cpd can be simultaneously attained perfectly regardless of how little you are attached to them ($\beta$) and the strength of the bias towards uncertainty $(\gamma)$.
	However, not all PDGs have the particularly nice structure,
        and these parameters will be important once there starts to be
        possible conflict between beliefs.

\label{sec:factor-graphs}
%oli8: moved all of the original material to the appendix, this section is new.
%joe7
%	Factor graphs \cite{koller2009probabilistic}, make some
%        similar promises to PDGs. They generalize BNs, the barrier to
%        adding observations is extremely low, and their failure to
%        normalize in general may be viewed as a kind of inconsistency
%        in a very similar fashion \cite{wainwright2008graphical}.
%joe18: we may want to cite the original paper on factor graphs here,
%along with (probably more accessible) KF09; I on'd tfeel strongly
%about this though.
%oli21: added refernece; is easy to remove. I've also subsituted
% the wainwright reference because it's much more focused on factor graphs
% and the authors more strongly take the "factor graphs generalize BNs" position.
% Factor graphs \cite{KF09},
Factor graphs 
%oli22: The original paper is actually really persuasive and arguably
%a better introduction
%joe20: you need to send me an updated bib file

\cite{kschischang2001sumproduct},
%	like PDGs, generalize BNs and have a low barrier to adding observations.
%joe19: we never discuss adding observations to a factor graph
%	like PDGs, generalize BNs.
%oli22: fair. On the other hand, they are clearly less strict and
% anyone who knows about them will identify that they solve the "we can't 
% legally add this information" problem.
%oli22: also, I want to soften this b/c  while they can represent the 
% distribution of any quantitative BN, they don't capture the 
% indepencencies of a qualitative BN  (though directed factor graphs do) and
% do not contain the counterfactual information that a BN does. 
% This may seem like a technicality, but it is actually a core part of the
% story: the factor graph representation does not exactly capture the BN; its
% sensitivity to future additions &  depenednce on \gamma,\beta are features
% that the BN does not have.
%Rewording:
%joe20: why is it just ``claim''.  They clearly do, in a precise
%sense.  In what sense are they more modular?  I've never seen the
%modularity of factor graphs discussed; rather, the claim is that
%having the factors makes this more efficent computationally.  Why
%make statements that may be controversial or unclar, that we don't
%make se of anywhere?  This is not a paper on factor graphs.
%like PDGs, claim to generalize BNs, and are also much more modular.
like PDGs, generalize BNs.
%oli22: I still would defend this, but let's not go there right now. Most
%people would agree with
%*%
%joe20: maybe, but what about those that don't?  why introduce this
%when we don't need it.
% moreover, their failure to
%         normalize in general may be viewed as a way of representing
%         some inconsistency.
%oli22: introduce one more acronym
% In this section, we consider the relationship between factor graphs and PDGs.
In this section, we consider the relationship between factor graphs (FGs) and PDGs.
\begin{defn}
%oli22: if "set" is preferable to "collection" for indexed sets when
% we define PDGs, it's certainly prefereable here also. 
 % A \emph{factor graph} $\Phi$ is a collection of random variables
 A \emph{factor graph} $\Phi$ is a set of random variables
        $\mathcal X = \{X_i\}$ and \emph{factors}
       $\{\phi_J\colon \V(X_J) \to \mathbb R_{\geq0}\}_{J \in
%joe19
%\mathcal J }$ %where each $J \in \mathcal J$ is associated
\mathcal J }$,
%joe19
%where each $X_J \subseteq \mathcal X$.
%more precisely, each factor $\phi_J$ is associated with a subset
where $X_J \subseteq \mathcal X$.  
More precisely, each factor $\phi_J$ is associated with a subset
$X_J\subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of variables, and maps
joint settings of $X_J$ to non-negative real numbers.
%
%oli23*:moving this material inside the definition
$\Phi$ specifies a distribution
\[ {\Pr}_{\Phi}(\vec x) = \frac{1}{Z_{\Phi}}
 	\prod_{J \in \cal J} \phi_J(\vec x_J), \]
%joe21
%where $\vec{x}$ is a joint setting on all of the variables,
where $\vec{x}$ is a joint setting of all of the variables,
 $\vec{x}_J$ is the restriction of $\vec{x}$ to only the
 variables $X_J$, and $Z_{\Phi}$ is the constant required to
 normalize the distribution.  
\end{defn}

%oli23*: moved all of this material below
% We take a \emph{weighted factor graph} $\Psi$ to be a pair $(\Phi,\theta)$ consisting of a factor graph $\Phi$  together with a vector of non-negative weights  $\{ \theta_J \}_{J \in \mathcal J}$.
% $\Psi$ specifies a distribution 
%oli23: refactor, using \Phi here, no weights, \Psi later.
% \[ {\Pr}_{\Psi}(\vec x) = \frac{1}{Z_{\Psi}}
% \[ {\Pr}_{(\Phi,\theta)}(\vec x) = \frac{1}{Z_{\Phi,\theta}}
% 		\prod_{J \in \cal J} \phi_J(\vec x_J)^{\theta_J} \]


%oli23: eliminating this is a benefit of the refactor
	% A factor graph $\Phi$ defines a distribution $\Pr_\Phi$ and scoring function 
	% $\GFE_{\Phi}$ by implicitly taking every $\theta_J = 1$.

%joe21: this isn't a good story
%The cpds of a PDG straightforwardly constitute the data of a factor graph.
%oli24: I think it's way more persuasive if we just interpret the data
% that's already there in its natural way, rather than actively "associating".
% Besides, the symmetry is not there. I'm doing one translation to 
% show that PDG semantics are not just multiply-the-cpts likea  factor graph
% would do, and the other translation to show we can emulate them; I want one
% to succeed and the other to fail. The one I want to fail definiitely needs
% to be set up as naturally as possible.
	% We can associate with each PDG a unique factor graph and vice versa.
	% The map from PDGs to factor graphs takes the cpds of the PDG to be the
	% facotors of the factor graph.  
%joe22: I changed it because I don't understand the phrase ``data of a
%factor graph''.  Databases have data; factor graphs don't.  I think
%you're using idiosyncratic terminology.  This isn't a great disaster
%-- I think the intent is clear -- but I don't like the terminology,
%although I didn't change it
%oli25: I started using the term "data" because you wrote something that way,
% but It's certainly not my favorite term and I'm open to swapping it out.
% More broadly though, I hope you can see why the "we can associate one to 
% another" story I don't find satisfying. I'm changing the phrase
% "data of a factor graph".
%oli25
%The cpds of a PDG straightforwardly constitute the  data of a factor graph,
%joe23: this version is OK, as far as I''m concerned 
The cpds of a PDG naturally constitute a collection of factors,
so it natural to wonder how the semantics of a PDG compare to 
simply treating the cpds as factors. To answer this question, we start by making
the translation precise.

%oli24: I placed the comment in the beginning; this is really not as ad-hoc
% as this notation makes it seem.
%joe22* You have to remind the reader of this convention!  It's not OK
%to use it pages after you've defined 3 pages back (which the reader
%probably missed) it without a reminder.  Be nice to the reader!
%joe23*: I'm willing to live with your notation, but you *must* remind

%This is an instance of a general principal: define a notion when you
%need it.  I see no class of reader for which there's a benefit it in
%defining it on page 3 and using it for the first time on p. 6.

%oli23*: added important discussion.
The correspondence hinges on the fact that we take $\gamma=1$, so that $\Inc$ and

%oli24: important discussion.
%joe22*: I find this discussion problematic, since we haven't
%discussed where teh choice of \gamma is coming from. It's not at all clear
%to me that this limitation is unproblematic.  We've solved a problem
%by giving the modeler the freedom to choose k without explaining why
%a particular choice is OK.  I think that the paper is worse off by
%this addition; you're just reminding the reader of our unmotivated
%choices (which I viewed as technical means to get a result, rather
%than natural modeling choices).  
%oli25*: You may view it as a technical means to get the paper to work out,
% but I definitely do not view it that way.
%joe23*: I understand that, but we don't exlain your point of view in
%the paper.   We have given no basis on which to claim something is ``not
%problematic''.   Saying it is will raise flags, so is a net negative.
%Similarly for the claim that we can't get a factor graph to
%``replace'' a PDG.  If a user is perfectly happy with a
%representation using a factor graph, why should he/she want to
%replace it by a PDG?  There is perhaps a point to be made here, but
%it needs to be written in a way that seems reasonable to a reader who
%hasn't read your mind and does not necessarily agree with our viewpoint.
%Moreover, the way the
% paper is currently 
% written, I think that \gamma is motivated fairly well (it's a
% trade-off between 
% a quantiative (by which I mean, "dependent on the cpds") and qualitative (by 
% which I mean, "dependent only on the graph structure") term, and readers
% with some imagination will have some ideas for how to use this. I
% certainly do. 
% In any case, here we only say that it indexes the family of a semantics, whch
% is just another technical fact, and I thiknk drawing attention to it strengthens
% our point a lot.
Because the user of a PDG gets to choose $\gamma$, the fact that the 
translation from WFGs to PDGs holds only for $\gamma=k$ is not problematic; 
the user can simply set $\gamma$ so as to view the original factor graph.
However, in translating back, we lose this ability, making it very difficult for
a factor graph replace a PDG.



%joe21
%What about weighted PDGs, of the form $(\Gr, \mat p, \beta)$?
%Factor graphs, too, have a standard notion of weightedness, 
%but so long as we stick with our convention of setting every $\alpha_L = 1$, 
%we cannot say much about them.
What about weighted PDGs $(\Gr, \mat p, \beta)$ where $\beta \ne {\bf 1}$?
There is also a standard notion of weighted factor graph,
but as long as we stick with our convention of taking  $\alpha = {\bf 1}$, 
we cannot relate them to weighted PDGs.  
%oli24: squeezing some more space
% As we show in the next section,
As we are about to see,
once we drop this convention, we can do much more.

%joe18*: rewrote.  Assuming we keep this, the real question is where
%we introduce \alpha.  If we introduce it at the beginning, then we
%need to include it in the BN theorem and were really should give more
%intuition (which we'll have a hard time agreeing on, based on past
%history), although perhaps we can get away with saying that we'll
%just use it in a technical way.  Obviously, if we include it, we
%shold get rid of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, and just use the stronger version.

%to explain how to add the \alphas.  Will you add them in such a way
%that the ratio of \beta_L to \alpha_L is constant?  If so, we can say
%that because the construction made it a constant, the following result holds.
%If the updated Definition 4.3 allows some flexibility in
%choosing \alpha and \beta, then this would reqire more work.
%oli21: Oops, I forgot to add those two characters; we set \alpha_L = \beta_L. 
% In any case, I think the true things you say above can be sold better:
%joe19: As I said, I don't believe that you want \alpha_L = \beta_L
%oli22**: Since in general we cannot know gamma (because the translation meerely
% supplies the data of the PDG, including alpha and beta, but a user can
% laterquery the semantics for multiple different values of gamma),
% we can't do any better than to set them to be proportional. 1 is a nice
% nice multiplicative constant generally, and also is speial because that's the 
% one we need to capture unweighted factor graphs with unweighted PDGs.

%joe19*: AARGH!  I was hoping that you would discuss the more general
%translation here, where \alpha could be arbitrar.  I don't believe
%that the reslt will hold if \alpha_L = \beta_L.  As you ptoint out,
%we need \beta_L = \alpha_L \gamma not \alpha_L = \beta_L.  So
%although you spent a lot of time doing what I explicitly asked you to
%do, you didn't address my main concerns.  You absolutely did not
%explain how to do  the translation when you have an abtrary weight vector.
%specify how you do the translatin here from factor graphs to PDGs.
%I put in what I think you should have put in.
%oli22: As stated in emails, I believe your conversion is correct but 
% slightly deceptive. I have therefore recycled 
The key benefit in using $\alpha$ is that we can
capture arbitrary WFGs, not just ones with a constant weight
vector.    All we have to do is to ensure that in our translation from
factor graphs to PDGs, the ratio ratio $\alpha_L/\beta_L$ is a
constant.  (Of course, if we allow arbitrary weights, we cannot hope
to do this if $\alpha_L = 1$ for all edges $L$.)

Specifically, given
$0 < \gamma \le 1$ and a WFG $\Psi = (\Phi,\theta)$, we take the PDG
${\dg M}_{\Psi,\gamma}$ to be defined just like the PDG ${\dg M}_\Psi$ of
Definition~\ref{def:fg2PDG}, except that instead of having $\alpha_L =

% Justification for both theorems is provided by rewriting
%joe18*: We need to add a proof for this result in teh appendix.
%The truth of \Cref{thm:fg-is-pdg,thm:pdg-is-fg} may be seen
%intuitively by rewriting 
The key step in proving \Cref{thm:wfg-is-pdg,thm:pdg-is-wfg}
(and in the proofs of a number of other results) involves 
rewriting  
$\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ as follows: 
\begin{prop}[restate=prop:nice-score,label=prop:nice-score]% \label{}
% \begin{restatable}{prop}{propnicescore}\label{prop:nice-score}
 Letting $x^{\mat w}$ and $y^{\mat w}$ denote the values of
  $X$ and $Y$, respectively, in $\mat w \in \V(\dg M)$, 
we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:semantics-breakdown}
\begin{split}
%joe17*: Now that I look at it again, this is horrible notation, and
%it confused me for a whle.  When we write E(X), X is a random
%variable.  So what random variable are you taking the expectation of
%Look at the last term.  You wrote \mu(w), but that's not a random
%variable.  (I suspect that there's a typo here and it should
%be \mu(\mat w).  But, in any case, that's a value, not a random
%varaible (which is a function.  I just got rid of the E and corrected
%the typo, so it least now it's mathematically correct.
%oli20: Hmm. I'm willing to accept the change, but I don't buy the
%argument. Is there something wrong with regarding $\mu(\mat w)$ as a
%random variable which depends on \mu? It clearly is a function from
%worlds to reals. Convention, exepctation is quite common in such
%contexts in information theory, and quite intuitive (for instance,
%the entropy = "expected surprise" relies on this). As a matter of
%consistency, you should be aware that we do a very similar thing in
%the definition of Inc: there's an expected  divergence
%from \mu(Y|x). This kind of term is common, the expectation is the
%standard way to write it.
%joe18: you're right; we do it there, and it's a bad abuse of notation
%there too.  Probabilists have this unfortunate habit of using what I
%find terribly confusing notation.  I always feel forced to unpack
%it.  How many people who read this even realize that a random
%variable is not a variable and is not random, but is a function.  I
%would actually prefer to rewrite Definition 3.2 this way as well.  I

some strange
behavior in factor graphs trying to capture the same phenomena as
PDGs, as the following example shows.

\begin{example}\label{ex:overdet}
Consider the PDG $\dg M$ containing just $X$ and $1$, and two edges
$p, q: 1 \to X$.
%joe8:
(Recall that such a PDG can arise if we get different information about the
probability of $X$ from two different

%joe17: I don't understand.  Such a PDG can arise whether or not the

%don't know them to be independent, so we cannot make this inference. Thoughts?
%joe18: This is not the place to discuss these issues.  We're just

%The issue of combining .7 and .7, and possibly getting .85 needs

certainly want to be able to capture!)
Consider the simplest situation, where $p$ and $q$ are both associated
with the same distribution on $X$%

; further suppose that the agent is certain about the distribution, so
$\beta_p = \beta_q = 1$.
%joe18*: what abou \alpha?  If we introduce it, we have to say
%something about it here.
For definiteness, suppose that
$\V(X) = \{x_1,x_2\}$, and
that the distribution associated with both edges is $\mu_{.7}$, which ascribes
%joe9: slowing down.
%probability $.7$ to $x_1$, then  $\bbr{\dg M} = \{\mu_{.7}\}$,
%while it can be shown that 
probability $.7$ to $x_1$. Then, as we would hope  $\bbr{\dg M}^* =
\{\mu_{.7}\}$; after all, both sources agree on the information.
However, it can be shown that 
%oli20: some M's escaped. Added msising subscript.
% $\Pr_{\Phi{{\dg M')}}} = \mu_{.85}$, so  $\bbr{\dg M'} = \{\mu_{.85}\}$.
%joe18: there's a typo here: I wrote what I thought you intended
%$\Pr_{\Phi{{\dg M)}}} = \mu_{.85}$, so  $\bbr{\dg M}_1^* = \{\mu_{.85}\}$.
%oli21: 
% $\Pr_{\Phi_{{\dg M)},1)}} = \mu_{.85}$, so  $\bbr{\dg M}_1^* = \{\mu_{.85}\}$.
%joe19*: this is now inconsistent with the notation I introduced.  If
%you're happy with what I did, it should be corrected.
$\Pr_{\WFGof{\dg M}} = \mu_{.85}$, so  $\bbr{\dg M}_1^* = \{\mu_{.85}\}$.
%joe18*: this arguably also shows the problem with the \bbr{\dg M}_k^*
%semantics when k \ne 0.  We should say something about that.
%oli21: A more accurate takeaway is that if \gamma is strictly
%positive, then a messed 
% up qualitative picture will impact the semantics.

%oli20: commenting out, see discussion + replacement below.
% the best distribution would put all mass on the worlds with maximum likelihood.
%joe17: I really don't like ``devoid of unceratinty''!  Moreover, if
%there isn't a unique world of maximum likelihood, why is there no
%uncertainty?  
%oli20*: while there may be multiple, any "uncertainty" is extremely fragile. 
% With any real data, there is a unique best world with probability 1.If we add
% epsilon noise to every cpt entry, there is a unique best world with probability 1.
% In the same vein: the only way it is possible for an interior point to have any probability at all, is if the product of the factors is is the constant function. 
%oli20: A simple example: a binary variable X, with an edge from 1 and an unconditional distribution % p(X=1) = 0.5 + \epsilon.  But X=1 is the only maximum likelihood world, so the optimal distribution is % the one that places all mass on X=1.  Taking this distribution seems hugely overconfident, and is totally in conflict with the uncertainty in the cpt. This is essentially what is hapepning in a factor graph. 
%oli20: trying again.
%joe18: this is not helpful  
%The log likelihood term
%%, which is as the cross entropy, 
%is the only term that makes use of the cpds.
%joe18*: in what sense is it the most important?
%so in some sense it is the most important.  
%oli21: (because it's the only term that depends on the cpds)
%joe18*: Sorry, I can't make any sense of the next sentence.  In what
%sense are the distributions miscalibrated?
%On its own, however, the distributions it selects are badly
%miscalibrated, placing all mass on worlds with the very highest
%likelihood.
%joe18*: the best distance by what metric?
%oli21: (metric=scoring function with only log likelihood term)
%For instance, the best distribution in \cref{ex:overdet}
%by this metric is $\mu_{1.0}$, even if only link $p$ were given ---
%which is in direct conflict with $p$ itself.  
%Such a distribution is devoid of uncertainty, which usually is in direct
%conflict with the data of the cpds $\mat p$.
%joe17: What issue is it resolving?  How is it resolving it?
%oli20: hopefully clearer now; I'm uncommenting and expanding.
%joe18*: I'm afraid it's not at all clear, and I still have no idea
%what issue is being resolved.
%A factor graph essentially resolves this issue by
%also including the final term,
%oli20: added
%joe18*: Sorry, I can't make any sense of this.  What does it mean to
%``properly balance'' something.  How can ou tell if it's ``properly
%balanced''.  
%oli21*: By "balanced", I am referring technically to the situation where they
% have the same coefficient. But saying this doesn't describe the effect:
% When the coefficient on a regularization term, log[ 1 / \mu(x) ], equals the
% coefficient on the energy term, log [ 1 / p(x)], for some fixed p, the
% distribution \mu that minimizes the total is p (because their sum is then the KL
% divergence from \mu to p).  If the regularization term
% had a smaller coefficient, the optimal \mu would be distorted to be more
% deterministic than p, and if it had a smaller one, it would be more spread
% out. I claim that if p is meant as a description of the actual probability and
% not just some measure of relative goodness, then balancing the two terms is
% important.  
%
%which imposes a cost for uncertainy. For the PDG consisting of only
%$p : 1 \to X$ from \cref{ex:overdet}, this results in $\bbr{1 \to
%p}^* = p$. As we have seen, adding $q$ . It seems that as long as our
%regularization term remains agnostic to the number of links in the
%graph, and which nodes they attach to, it cannot properly balance the
%likelihood so that the cpt is satisfied.    

%joe18*: The next sentence should go earlier, after we've talked about
%that first and last terms of (5) captring the free energy.
%oli21: I keep trying to tell a story about what the equation does by building
% up the terms, but I'm not getting through. I think without communicating the
% instability + overconfidence of the likelihood term, and its standard 
% resolution which involves the free energy, it's not really worth saying this anymore.
%The scoring function that we use for PDGs can thus be viewed as
%joe19: moved up from below, with minor changes to make it flow better.
Although both $\theta$ and $\beta$ are measures of confidence,

%the regularization terms are thus necessary to model uncertainty.
%You need to say something about how, although they're not
%regluarization terms as the term is used in the ML community (since
%we are *not* doing machine learning), they have some of the same spirit.
%joe15*: Why are regularization terms necessary to model uncertainty?
%All that you can say is here is that they're necessary to capture
%this particular socirng function
%oli17*: No, this is much weaker than what I want to say. These terms

%point mass on a particular world. 
%oli17: Unsure if helpful, but the thermodynamic analogy is
%temperature=0 Kelvin,

%This follows from \cref{ex:overdet} the fact that doubling $\theta_J$

%The behavior in \cref{ex:overdet} also sheds some light on the nature

%expectation, it will hurt more than it will help.  Do NOT
%make further changes without discussion (other than correcting typos)
%$\beta$ simultaneously controls both the local likelihood and local

% terms (in the limit as \gamma -> 0)
%joe16: As a technical matter, I don't see why this is true.  I don't
%see in what sense \beta preserves anything.  It's just a number that
%you miltiply the difference between the terms by.  
%oli17: and the cpds that that optimize it remain the same.
%joe16: The same as what?  I'm totally lost

\subsection{Dependency Networks}

PDGs are closely related to Dependency Networks, or DNs
\cite{heckerman2000dependency}. The data of a DN is also an unstructured
collection of cpds, but the cpds are attached to nodes rather than edges, so
there must be exactly one per node.  \citeauthor{heckerman2000dependency} also
emphasize the benefit of being able to supply arbitrary data in the cpds,
without enforcing the consistency constraints.


\begin{defn}

A \emph{dependency network} is a tuple $\mathcal D = (\Gr, \mat p) $, where

directed graph of variables and $\mat p$ gives, for each $X \in \N$ a

Together with a total order $\prec$ on $\N$,
$\mathcal D$ defines a joint distribution $\Pr^\prec_{\mathcal D}$ on $\V(\N)$ via an \emph{ordered Gibbs sampler}.

% than I have written but I don't want to finish integrating it until after
% I've proven some results. >>
%
%This is clearer than what's written, but it's different from what you 
%wrote in our writeup, as near as I can tell.  But I think I see what's 
%going on, and how it should be explained (at least for me to understand 
%it).  First, you have tell me how to initialize x_1, ..., x_n (i.e., 
%what is x_1^0, ..., x_n^0).  We then define X_n^t by induction on t.  We 
%take X_0^t = (x_1^0, ..., x_n^0) (which I'm assuming is given somehow).  
%If t = nt'+i, we assume that we have defined x_j^0, \ldots, x_j^{t'} for 
%j < i and x_j^0, \ldots, x_j^{t'-1} for j \ge i.  We then define x_i^t' 
%to be the result of drawing a value according to the distribution 
%p_i(.|x_1^{t'}, ..., x_{i-1}^{t'}, x_i^{t'-1}, ...,  x_n^{t'-1}).   Then 
%we define X^t = (x_1^{t'}, x_i^{t'}, x_{i+1}^{t'-1}, ..., x_n^{t'-1}).
%
%Notice how different this description is from years.  Now you can point 
%out that the sequence X^0, X^1, ... can be viewed as a Markov chain.  
%However, you can't just say "you take the limiting distribution", 
%because the limiting distribution does not exist in general.  This is 
%where the fact that all the cpds (not *local distibutions, which is an 
%undefined term) are positive comes in; it ensures that the Markove chain 
%is irreducible, which in turn guarantees that there's a unique 
%stationary distribution. This should be pointed out.

The dependence on the order is artificial in the case that the DN is ``consistent'', which in the authors parlance implies that it also has their favored independencies.\footnote{Interestingly, any BN $\mathcal B$ is an ``inconsistent'' dependency network, despite the fact that the Gibbs sampler whose order $\prec$ is a topological sort  of $\cal B$, generates $\Pr_{\mathcal B}$.}

\begthm[\citeauthor{heckerman2000dependency}]{theorem}{thm:dns-uniq}
%Theorem 1. (wrapped into definiton above)
%An ordered Gibbs sampler applied to a dependency network for $\mat X$, where each $X_i$ is discrete and each local distribution $\bp[X](x \mid \mat{pa}(X))$ is positive, has a unique stationary joint distribution for $\mat X$.  
If a dependency network $\mathcal D \!=\! (\Gr, \mat p)$ over variables $\N$ is consistent with a positive joint distribution $p$,
in that $p(X \mid \N\setminus \{X\}) = \bp[X](X \mid \Pa^{\Gr}(X))$ for all $X \in \N$,
 then $\Pr_{\mathcal D}^\prec = p$.
\end{theorem}

A dependency network $\mathcal D$, together with any a vector of confidences $\beta$ for the cpds on each variable
% (defaulting to $\beta_X=1$) 
can be naturally regarded as a PDG $\PDGof{\mathcal D, \beta}$ 
via the same translation used for a Bayesian Network.
Although on the surface PDG and DN semantics are quite
different,
the former subsumes the latter, as the next results show.


%\begin{lemma}
%	A distribution $\mu$ that locally minimizes $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal D, \beta}}$ satisfies all of the independencies of $\mathcal D$.
%\end{lemma}


\begthm{conj}{thm:dns-are-pdgs}
%oli22: updating theorem statement
% If $\mathcal D = (\N, \Ed, \V, \mathcal P)$ is a consistent dependency network with a positive stationary distribution $p^*$ of its sampling procedure, then the PDG $\PDGof{\mathcal D} = (\N, \mathit{merge}(\Ed), \V, $$\mathcal P, \mat 1\valpha{, $\mat 1$})$, then $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal D}} = p^*$.
If $\mathcal D$ is a consistent dependency network,
%with positive local distributions,
then for all positive vectors $\beta$, and all orders $\prec$, we have that

$\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal D, \beta}}^* =  \Pr_{\cal D}^\prec$.
%, where $\Pr_{\cal D}^\prec$ is the unique stationary distribution of the $\prec$-ordered Gibbs sampling procedure. 
\end{conj}

Inconsistent DNs still define a unique distribution, but we cannot hope that it 
will be the same one as generated by the PDG, owing to the fact that
the Gibbs sampler defined by \citeauthor{heckerman2000dependency} is dependent
on the (arbitrary) fixed order used in sampling.
A PDG can simulate the effect of the order with the reliability $\beta$.

\begin{conj}
If $\mathcal D$ is a dependency network over the variables
$X_1 \prec X_2  \ldots  \prec X_n$ is a total order on the variables, and $\beta$ is a vector over the edges
%oli22: to preemptively eliminate some confusion:
% (which have a 1-1 correspondence with variables in a DN) 
such that  $\beta_1 \ll\beta_2 \ll \ldots \ll \beta_n$, 
then $\Pr_{\cal D}^{\prec} = \bbr{\dg M; \beta}^*$
\end{conj}

A \emph{random scan} Gibbs sampler, rather than cycling though variables in a 
particular order, draws the next variable index to update randomly.
Given a distribution $d$ over $\N$,
let $\mathit{RScan}(d)$ be the random scan Gibbs sampling procedure that draws
the next variable to update from $d$. $\mathit{RScan}(d)$ also has a unique stationary distribution, $\Pr_{\mathcal D}^d$, which is equal to $\Pr_{\cal D}^{\prec}$ for any $d$ and $\prec$ if $\mathcal D$ is a consistent DN. This more symmetric procedure is captured nicely by PDG semantics.

\begin{conj}\label{thm:dns-are-completely-pdgs}
	Let $d(X) \propto \beta_X$. Then
	$\Pr_{\mathcal D}^d = \bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal D, \beta}}^*$, whether or not $\mathcal D$ is consistent.

%\section{Using Inconsistency}
\section{Capturing Updating using PDGs vian Inconsistency}
%oli8: remove subsection
	% \subsection{BELIEF UPDATING} 
%oli8: I don't know if it's reasonable to keep this for the final version, but I think it's 
% one of the most important classes of example (where we add scaffolding and reason about a digram without altering its contents). It does not require any additional theory, and we keep cutting the things of this flavor.
	\label{sec:belief-update}
	%oli20: lots of edits in this section.
	Belief updating, through Bayes' or more generally Jeffrey's rule, can be thought of as the addition of a new marginal to a distribution, and then a resolution of inconsistency. In  \cite{dietrich2016belief}, for instance, a belief update $p \mapsto p_I$ takes a belief state $p$ to a new one consistent with the input $I$. We can do this with PDGs. 
	
	% For us, belief revision consists simply of the addition of a new edge to the picture, followed by a resolution of the resulting inconsistency. 
	\begin{example}
		Suppose that we have a variable $W$ of possible worlds, over which $B$ is a random  variable, and $p$ is an unconditional distribution. This data can be encoded in a PDG $\dg M$ as links $\ed{p}{1}{W}$ and $W \tto B$.
		Now, suppose we noisily observe $B$, giving a distribution $\pi$ over $B$. We add $\ed\pi1W$ to $\dg M$, which then becomes inconsistent (so long as $\pi \neq p(B)$). To resolve the inconsistency, we look to $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, the closest joint distribution on $\{W, B, 1\}$. Because $B$ is a function of $W$ and $1$ has only a single value, $\bbr{\dg M}$ is isomorphic to a distribution on $W$, which we adopt as $p'$.  $\bbr{\dg M}$ will likely be a compromise between $p$ and $\pi$, but if we trust the observation a lot more than the prior $(\beta_\pi \gg \beta_p)$, then $\bbr{\dg M}$ will be consistent with $\pi$. In this case, $\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) = \kldiv{\mu}{p}$, which is is uniquely minimized among those $\mu$ consistent with $\pi$ by applying Jeffrey's rule \cite{halpern2017reasoning}. See \cref{fig:belief-update} for an illustration.
	\end{example}

	% With reference to \Cref{fig:belief-update}, an extension of \Cref{ex:randomvars}, consider the following update. 
	% Upon noisily observing the variable $B$ to with probabilities indexed by , Jeffrey's rule prescribes a posterior probability $p'$ of any event $E$ by:
	% \[ p'(E) = \sum_{b \in B} p(E \mid B\sheq b) \pi_b \]
	% Bayes Rule corresponds the particular case of Jeffrey's rule, in which the variable is binary and the outcome is certain.

	% To understand the update visually in \Cref{fig:belief-update}, imagine the original distribution $p$ from $\sf 1$ to $W$ being replaced by the path $p' := p(W \mid B) \circ \pi$  on the left. The gray arrow on the bottom left is the definition of the random variable, as in \Cref{ex:randomvars}, and the dashed one is its inversion, which can be computed by Bayes' rule.  %that factors through $B$ via the new observation $\pi$.
	% To query the resulting distribution on, an arbitrary event $E$, with an indicator variable of the same name. Initially, we got a marginal on $E$ by going through $p$; we now use $p'$. Effectively, the orange path to $E$ has been replaced by the blue one.
	% 
	% 
	% To observe $\pi$, we simply view it as a cpd conditioned on $\star$ and add it to our collection. 
	% Although it is likely to be inconsistent, resolving this inconsistency in a way that retains $\pi$ is a belief update. 
	% Even failure retain $\pi$ entirely may not be a concern: so long as an they continue to observe or remember, an agent endures discomfort until $\pi$ is incorporated. This setting is arguably more natural than a standard one: without spending energy, it is easy to forget or partially reject implications of the observation.	
	% Once again, with a PDG, the resolution need not happen immediately. This makes the approach more convincing for cognitively bounded agents, who might have more pressing matters than sorting through beliefs, and who might do them out of order.

	\subsection{Sampling}
	
	One of the nice about directed graphical models is that the model itself is roughly a sampling algorithm. For instance, taking a Bayes Net $\cal B$ and generating samples according to the tables is an efficient way to sample $\Pr_{\mathcal B}$.

	This works because there is only one path, but more generally, for any conditional marginal $Y|X$, we can think of all of the different paths in the PDG different ways an agent with knowledge $\dg M$ can get probabilistic estimates of the conditional distribution $\bbr{\dg M}\MaxEnt(Y | X)$. The next result states that, in a precise sense, these various estimates bound the location of the marginal for this maximum entropy distribution, which suggests an efficient sampling algorithm for $\bbr{\dg M}\MaxEnt(Y | X)$, after learning some weights.
	
	\begin{conj}\label{thm:maxent-hull}
		For any PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ containing variables $X, Y$, the maximum entropy conditional marginal $\bbr{\dg M}\MaxEnt(y \mid x)$ is a convex mixture of the conditional marginals generated by the paths from $X$ to $Y$.  That is, there exist weights $\{\alpha_i \geq 0\}$ on the paths in $\dg M$ and a bias weight $\alpha_0$ with $\sum_i {\alpha_i} = 1$ and
		\[ \bbr{\dg M}\MaxEnt(Y \mid X) = \alpha_0 \  p^{\text{unif}}_Y \sum_{p \in \bbr{\dg M}_\lambda(X, Y)} \alpha_i (p_1 \circ \ldots \circ p_k) \]
		where $p^{\text{unif}}_Y$ is the uniform distribution on $Y$, and $\bbr{\dg M}_\lambda(X,Y)$ is the set of paths from $X$ to $Y$ generated by composition and Bayes Rule in $\dg M$. 
	\end{conj}

	One natural choice of these $\alpha$'s is the certainty scores for each edge, given by a weighted PDG, but we do not have any further formal results in this direction.
	Note that it is common for humans to make decisions in this way: to estimate whether something is realistic by following multiple chains of reasoning weighting them by strength of argument.
	
%	\begin{conj}
%		The conditional marginal of the maximum entropy distribution $\bbr{M}\MaxEnt(b \mid a)$ is in the convex hull of the compositions of paths $A \to B$.

	\section{Discussion}
        %oli8: entirely rewritten.
%joe7* It will need to be rewritten again, I'm afraid.  We should hint
%at what PDGs are good for: the fact that we can keep track of
%different, possibly conflict sources of information (we should make a
%bigger deal of that in the intro), the fact that we can capture lots
%of distributions (we hinted at that; can we say more?), the fact that
%they are modular (which lets us put together different sources of
%information) and the fact
%that we can model inconsistency and how people recover from
%inconsisency.  This will require us to get into the dynamics of PDGs
%(how people recover from inconsistency) and will require another
%paper, but we should mention it here.  A good discussion will easily
%fill up the 8th page.
%oli9: I agree, this plan sounds excellent. While you do your pass, I will write a draft of this in a separate document. 
%oli10        
\commentout{
	Given more computation, would your beliefs be more consistent? Or would you explore further, forming more extensive networks of them?
	The canonical picture of an idealized agent has always given the first answer, but this may not necessarily be the case.
}
 
 	% Do dogs have more or less consistent beliefs than we do? 
%oli8
	% They may just not have as many concepts.
	% It may be that they are no less consistent, but just have fewer concetpts.

%oli10: deleted the previous text, 
	% We have given the semantics of PDGs, a modeling framework that enables formal reasoning about this kind of mental state, and is strictly more expressive than the class of Bayesian Networks. The scoring semantics for fixed $\beta_L = \gamma = 1$ recovers the factor graph. The distribution given by a PDG, however is not generally this one, but rather one that is as consistent as possible with the supplied cpds.
	% 
	% The material covered in the present paper is only part of the picture. There are two very important generalizations that we plan to cover next. First, by minorly relaxing the definition of a cpd so that it doesn't need to provide a distribution for a special \texttt{null} value, we gain a huge amount of expressive power, allowing for simpler representations of events and partial knowledge.
 	% Second, while we have discussed what happens in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$, emphasizing the quantitative part of the PDG, there is also a rich story to be told about the qualitative half. Together with the modularity provided by the PDG, and the relaxation to strict PDGs, PDGs are able to function as causal models.
%oli10: new text.
%joe9*: rewrote completely.  You have a few lines to say more.  It
%would also be good to squeeze in somewhere something about related
%work (e.g., perhaps dependency networks).
\commentout{
PDGs are a powerful tool for representing local probabilistic information.
	Though represented by a graph, the edges are interpreted
        differently. Each edge alone determines a cpd, making PDGs
        formally analogous to a commutative diagram, instead of a
        flow-chart. A more familiar network can be obtained with the
        use of multi-tailed arrows. 

	PDGs have a parameterized semantics $[[ - ]]_\gamma$, which always generalizes Bayesian Networks, and precisely becomes a factor graph when $\gamma=1$.  This exposes an implicit trade-off between quantitative and qualitative data; the two behave very differently, but are unfortunately fused in a factor graph. Both qualitative and quantitative information can be inconsistent, although the former is less straightforward, this preliminary paper we focus on the quantitative limit.

	Incorporating new variables, data, or restricting to subgraphs
        of a PDG is simple, making it possible to construct one by
        simply throwing together some pre-trained statistical
        models. Moreover, in the quantitative limit, PDGs continue to
        have local meaning, in stark contrast with energy-based models
        such as factor graphs. As a result, PDGs are not only a
        flexible representation, but modular as well. 

	The most dramatic feature of PDGs is their ability to deal with inconsistency. A PDG can track conflicting information from different sources, and its semantics identify when this occurs, rather than quietly sweeping problems under the rug.
	As a result, a user may resolve inconsistency in multiple ways. Inconsistency can be dealt with by updating one or multiple tables, by introducing introducing or splitting variables, or even left unresolved as as one searches for clarification. The pain of inconsistency can be mitigated by expressing a decreased confidence, without altering any data.

%joe10: This is not ``Moreover''.  It's not quite the right story

%naturally encoded as PDGs; the standard approaches to deal
%with them (resp.,
%variational inference, Bayesian updating) can be regarded as
%reductions of its inconsistency.   
Inconsistency resolution is a pervasive phenomenon.
%oli22: For example, belief updating can be naturally viewed as an instance of
% resolving inconsistency: this is not a good example, and duplicates the below.
% We now believe that something is true to
% which we earlier assigned probabiity less than 1.
For example, 
conditioning can be
viewed as a way of resolving that inconsistency (as can other more
general approaches to belief updating, such as Jeffrey's Rule
\cite{Jeffrey68};
%oli22:
we know that this generalization is cleanly captured with PDGs. 
Belief propogation, too, 
can be naturally regarded in this light: a collection of pseudomarginals are
that correspond to factor and variable beliefs may be inconsistent, and 
messsage passing algorithms are greedy mechanisms for reducing this inconsistency \cite{wainwright2008graphical}.
%oli24 inserted paragraph break

More distantly related tasks in other fields, such as variational inference in
machine learning, can also be framed as inconsistency reduction: a variational 
autoencoder is in some sense an assertion that both a distribution
and a variational approximation to it are both accurate; minimmizing
the inconsistency between them is the learning task \cite{kingma2013autoencoding}. In all three of these
examples, the objective can be written as a sum of relative entropies,
suggesting that we can apply PDGs without modification to capture an incredibly 
broad range of tasks and resolve them in a uniform way.

%you can write a clear, crisp sentence, we can add it.
%probability less than 
%problems (e.g., variational approximation, belief updating) are

% This makes representing inconsistent information using a PDG and then
% resolving it a topic that can have a potentially high payoff.
We hope to report on this in the future.

%oli22: added
%joe20: not for the abstract
%In writing this paper, we have also discovered several surprising
%connections 
%to other fields. For instance, the $G$-information defecit can be used to
%explain different kinds of dependencies in database theory, and the
%weights $\alpha$  
%act like a ``degree of causality'' (though the authors do not yet agree on how
%to present this, which is why its discussion has been minimized here).

%oli22: added
%joe20
%Finally, many standard algorithms for inference on graphical models 
%run out-of-the box on PDGs; we are also interested in characterizing their
%behavior and 
%providing alterations so that they yield resluts consistent with the semantics\
%oli24: this is a really weak way to end. I'm removing it.
% Although we have not considered computational issues here, many

	% \subsection{Probabilities Still Encode Well}	
	% In some sense, while we have yet to find a mental state that
	% is not encoded in some probability distribution, the choice
	% of underlying space is extremely important, and we argue
	% that it changes rapidly. Moreover, sometimes one has to make

		\subsection{Inconsistency} \label{sec:consistency-ethos}
	
		Believing a logically inconsistent formula can lead you to arbitrarily bad conclusions, having an infeasible set of constraints makes all answers you could give wrong, and having inconsistent preferences can lose you infinite money. We don't want to build inconsistent systems or agents with incoherent views of the world, and so, where possible, we design them so they cannot possibly be broken in this way. Suppose, for example, that we are trying to represent some quantity that must be a point on the unit circle. We could do it with an $x$ and $y$ coordinate, but this could be problematic because $x^2+ y^2$ might not be 1 --- it would be safer and harder to go awry if we parameterize it by an angle $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$ instead. In the absence of performance benefits (like needing to regularly use the $y$-coordinate and not wanting to compute a sine), why would we take the first approach, introducing a potentially complex data-invariant, when we could avoid it?
		
		This line of thought, though common and defensible, is flawed if we are not perfectly confident in the design of both our system and the ways it can interact with the outside world. Using similar logic, we might ask ourselves: Why ask programmers for type annotations when all instructions are operationally well-defined at run-time?  Why use extra training data if there's already enough there to specify a function? Why estimate a quantity in two ways when they will yield different answers? Why repeat and rephrase your ideas when this could make you contradict yourself? Why write test cases when they could fail and make the project inconsistent? Why conduct an experiment if it could just end up contradicting your current knowledge?
		
		These questions may seem silly, but there is a satisfying information theoretic answer to all of them: redundancy, though costly, is the primary tool that we use to combat the possibility of being wrong. Maintaining data invariants can be expensive but provides diagnostic information; in the example above, settings of $x$ and $y$ that don't lie on the unit circle provide diagnostic information that something has gone wrong.
		In many cases, it is also possible to paper over problems by forcibly re-instating local data invariants: for instance, we could re-normalize any values of $x$ and $y$ (so long as $xy \neq 0$; we can chose an arbitrary point otherwise) at every step. While this would reduce inconsistency, it also hides red flags.
		
		Using a Bayesian Network to represent a probability distribution is like representing a circle with $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$.
		By construction, the result must be a distribution, and nothing can possibly go wrong so long as we can always decide on exactly one distribution which is sufficient for our purposes.
		%	By construction, the result must be a point on the circle, and nothing can possibly go wrong so long as we're sure that we will always have exactly enough information to determine such a point (for instance, we could never be totally clueless about the point, or just know its $x$ coordinate).
		
		
		The process of mechanistically forcing invariants is homologous to the standard practice for factor graphs: practitioners will often just assume that the density it defines is normalizable, and either forcibly re-normalize or cleverly avoid computing the normalization constant while still assuming that one exists; behavior is usually left unspecified in the unlikely event that it is not defined or zero.

\subsection{Positive Impacts}
One can imagine many applications of enabling simple and coherent
aggregation of (possibly inconsistent) information. In particular we
can imagine using PDGs to build and interpret a communal and global
database of statistical models, in a way that may not only enable more
accurate predictions, but also highlights conflicts between
information.

%joe1: what does fairness have to do with any of the above or below?
%This could have a critical impact on the state of fairness.

Rather than trying to

to be used, it is not hard to imagine a world where a PDG gives biased and
poorly-thought out conclusions.
It is clear that PDGs need a great deal more
vetting before they can be used for such important purposes as
aggregating the world's statistical knowledge.

PDGs are powerful statistical models, but are by necessity
semantically more complicated than many existing methods. This will
likely restrict their accessibility. To mitigate this, we commit to
making sure our work is widely accessible to researchers of different
backgrounds.

	%joe9: removed section
%	\subsection{Standard Definitions and General Facts}
%joe9: let's be consistent and write \mu for the default distribution
%	For brevity, we use the standard notation and write $p(x, y)$
%        instead of $p(X \!=\! x, Y \!=\! y)$, $p(x \mid y)$ instead of
	%        $p(X \!=\! x\mid Y \!=\! y)$, and so forth.
		For brevity, we use the standard notation and write $\mu(x, y)$
	instead of $\mu(X \!=\! x, Y \!=\! y)$, $\mu(x \mid y)$ instead of
	$\mu(X \!=\! x\mid Y \!=\! y)$, and so forth.
%joe9: I don't understand this
%        So long as $x$ is bound solely as an element of $\V(X)$, the
%        meaning is unambiguous.  

	%joe9: this should go where we use it; I put it there
	\commentout{
\begin{defn}[Conditional Entropy]
	If $p$ is a distribution over a set $\Omega$ of out comes, and $X$ and $Y$ are random variables on $\Omega$, then the \emph{conditional entropy}, $\H_p(X \mid Y)$, is defined as 

\end{defn}

%joe9*: I think we shoul cut this; we don't need it.
	\begin{defn}[Sets as Variables] \label{def:set-rv}
	Sets of random variables as random variables. If $S$ is a set of random variables $X_i : \Omega \to \V(X_i)$ on the same set of outcomes $\Omega$, we consider $S$ itself to be the random variable taking values $\V(X) = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_i \ldots) \}$ for $x_i \in \V(X_i)$. Formally, we define its value on a world $\omega$ to be $S(\omega) := (X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_i(\omega), \ldots)$. 
\end{defn}

%joe9*: I think we should cut this; we don't need it.  We need strict
%convexity, which has a much simpler definition.                
%oli10: added
\begin{defn}[Strong Convexity] \label{def:strong-convexity}
	A real-valued function is $m$-\emph{strongly convex}, if there is a quadratic lower bound, with coefficient $m$, away from its first order approximation. More precisely, it is $m$ strongly convex if for every $x, y$ in its domain, 
	\[ f(y) \geq f(x) + \Big\langle\nabla f(x), y-x \Big\rangle + m\norm{x-y}^2_2 \]
\end{defn}

%joe9*: we should cut this; it's doubtless a standard reslt, and we
%don't need it.
%oli11: I actually asked Bobby for a reference and he said it was so
%standard that everyone just says it. He even looked through a couple
%standard convex analysis books and says it's not there. I proved it
%because you asked for a result I couldn't find one. 
%oli11: It may be worth keeping some of the strong convexity stuff
%around though; strong convexity is a _lot_ more useful for finding
%the minimum than strict convexity, and ML people will immediately
	%know that this means it is efficient.
%joe10: NO!  Don't clutter up the paper with things ou don't need!
	%This is bad style!
\begin{prop}\label{prop:neg-ent-convex}
%joe8*: you can't pull 1-strong convexity out of a hat, and define it
%in the proof.  You need to define it, and explain why you care.  Your
%proof also looks at hte function xlog x, so whynot state the
%proposition in terms of that?
%oli10: definition added above
  Negative entropy, restricted to a finite probability
			simplex, is 1-strongly convex. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	%https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3077287/how-to-show-negative-entropy-function-fx-x-logx-is-strongly-convex
	Let $X$ be a finite set; the function $f: \Delta(X) \to \mathbb R$ given by $\vec x \mapsto \sum x_i \log x_i$ is strongly convex, as 
	\begin{equation*}
		\partial_j f(\vec x) =  \partial_j\left[\sum_i x_i \log x_i \right] = 
			x_j \partial_j \big[\log x_j \big] + \log x_j = 1 + \log x_j
	\end{equation*}
	So
	\begin{align*}
		\Big\langle \nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y),~ x-y\Big\rangle 
			&= \sum_i \Big((\partial_i f)(\vec x) - (\partial_i f)(\vec y)\Big)(x_i - y_i) \\
			&= \sum_i \Big(\log x_i  - \log y_i \Big)(x_i - y_i) \\
			% &= \sum_i x_i \log x_i + y_i \log y_i + 2 
		\intertext{As $\log$ is concave, we have $\log(y_i) \leq \log(x_i) + (y_i-x_i) \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x_i} [\log(x_i)]$, and so $\log x_i - \log y_i \geq (1/x) (x - y)  \geq (x-y)$, we have}
		\Big\langle \nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y),~ x-y\Big\rangle
			&= \sum_i \Big(\log x_i  - \log y_i \Big)(x_i - y_i) \\ % from above
			&\geq \sum_i (x_i-y_i)^2 \cdot \frac1{x_i}\\
			&\geq \sum_i (x_i-y_i)^2 \\
			&= \norm{x-y}^2_2 \numberthis\label{proofeqn:strong1}
%joe9: When I latex this, I get the error ``You can't use `\halign' in
%math mode.''  (I've gotten this error all along; it's nothing new.) 
%oli11*: only in aligns that have a \numberthis, or all align environments?
% we should fix this...
%joe10: I'm not sure; I didn't check.  I shouldn't have to spend time
%doing thi!
	\end{align*}
	At the same time, the condition for convexity can be phrased in terms of gradients as the condition that for all $x,y$,
	\[  \Big\langle \nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y),~ x-y\Big\rangle \geq 0\]
	So together with \eqref{proofeqn:strong1}, we conclude that the function $f - \norm{x-y}^2_2$ is convex. Therefore, $f$ is 1-strongly convex.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Properties of Scoring Semantics}

%joe17*: If we use this theorem somewhere, it can stay.  But if not,
%we should cut it.  We should only include results we need.  Also,
%when I latex this, the theorem statement is missing.
%oli20: Yeah, this is a special case of another theorem, and we don't need it. 
% only useful as a property of the first semantics one might keep in mind.
\vleftovers{
	\thmsetconvex*
	\begin{proof}
		Choose any two distributions $p, q \in \SD{M}$ consistent with $M$, any mixture coefficient $\alpha \in [0,1]$, and any edge $(A,B) \in \Ed$.

		By the definition of $\SD{M}$, we have $p(B = b \mid A = a) = q(B = b \mid A = a) = \bmu_{A,B}(a,b)$.  
		For brevity, we will use little letters ($a$) in place of events ($A = a$).
		Therefore, $p(a\land b) = \bmu_{A,B}(a,b) p(a)$ and $q(ab) = \bmu_{A,B}(a,b) q(a)$. Some algebra reveals:
		\begin{align*}
			\Big( \alpha p + (1-\alpha) q \Big) (B = b \mid A = a) &= 
			\frac{\Big( \alpha p + (1-\alpha) q \Big) (b \land a)}{\Big( \alpha p + (1-\alpha) q \Big) (a)} \\
			&= \frac{ \alpha p(b \land a) + (1-\alpha) q(b \land a) }{\Big( \alpha p(a) + (1-\alpha) q (a)} \\
			&= \frac{ \alpha \bmu_{A,B}(a,b) p(a) + (1-\alpha) \bmu_{A,B}(a,b) q(a) }{\Big( \alpha p(a) + (1-\alpha) q (a)} \\
			&=\bmu_{A,B}(a,b) \left(\frac{ \alpha  p(a) + (1-\alpha) q(a) }{\Big( \alpha p(a) + (1-\alpha) q (a)}\right)\\
			&= \bmu_{A,B}(a,b)
		\end{align*}
		and so the mixture $\Big(\alpha p + (1-\alpha) q \Big)$ is also contained in $\SD{M}$.
	\end{proof}
}
%joe9: just because it's n appendix, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't
%tell a story.
%joe17: If we keep the previous result, this should go above it
In this section, we prove the properties of scoring functions that we
mentioned in the main text,
Propositions~\ref{prop:sd-is-zeroset}, \ref{prop:sem3}, and
\ref{prop:consist}.  We repeat the statements for the reader's convenience.

%joe9: put this first
%	\begin{prop}\label{prop:sd-is-zeroset}
%oli15: consistency
% \begin{old}{prop:sd-is-zeroset}
% 	For any PDG $\dg M$, $\SD{\dg M} = \{ \mu : \bbr{\dg M}_0(\mu) = 0\}$. 
% \end{old}
\recall{prop:sd-is-zeroset}
\begin{proof}
	 By taking $\gamma = 0$, the score is just $\Inc$. By
%joe9
%                 definition, any $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ satisfies all
%                 constraints, hence satisfies $\mu(Y \mid X=x) =
%                 \bp(x)$ for any $L \in \Ed^{\dg M}$ and $x$ with
%                 \bp(x)$ for any $L \in \Ed^{\dg M}$ and $x$ with
			 definition, a distribution $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ satisfies
	  all the
			 constraints, so $\mu(Y = \cdot \mid X=x) =
			 \bp(x)$ for all edges $X \rightarrow Y \in \Ed^{\dg
			   M}$ and $x$ with 
%joe9*: this needs a reference
%oli11
			 % $\mu(X=x)>0$. By Gibbs inequality,
			 $\mu(X=x)>0$. By Gibbs inequality
			 \cite{mackay2003information}, 
			 $\kldiv{\mu(Y|x)}{\bp(x)} = 0$. Since this is true
			 for all edges, we must have $\Inc_{\dg M}( \mu) =
			 0$. Conversely, if $\mu \notin \SD{\dg M}$, then it
			 fails to marginalize to the cpd $\bp$ on some edge
%joe9
			 %                 $L$, and so again by Gibbs inequality
							  $L$, and so again by Gibbs inequality,
			 $\kldiv{\mu(Y|x)}{\bp(x)} > 0$. As relative entropy
			 is non-negative, the sum of these terms over all
			 edges must be positive as well, and so $\Inc_{\dg M}(
			 \mu) \neq 0$. %This is true whether or not $\dg M$ is
						   %consistent. 
\end{proof}


%joe9
Before proving the remaining results, we prove a lemma that will be useful
in other contexts as well. 

%oli11: aaahhh it took me an hour to edit this, and I don't think
%anything even changed. 
% Why did you modify it? It was so much cleaner before.
%joe10: I thought it was overkill ... 
\begin{lemma}
	% [name=\Cref{prop:convex} analog, 	restate=thmincconvex]
	\label{thm:inc-convex}
	$\Inc_{\dg M}( \mu)$ is a convex function of $\mu$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%joe14: you need a reference for this
%oli16: I could not find it in MacKay, but it is in Cover and Thomas'
%"Elements of Information Theory". Citation added. 
  %  It is well-known that $\thickD$ is convex, in the sense that
    It is well known that $\thickD$ is convex \cite[Theorem
%joe15: for what it's worth, this was already in joe.bib.  I'm using
%that version, since it corrects some problems in your reference
%(e.g., book titles should be capitalized)
      %      2.7.2]{cover2012elements}, in the sense that
            2.7.2]{coverThomas}, in the sense that  
	\[ \kldiv{\lambda q_1 + (1-\lambda) q_2 }{ \lambda p_1
			  + (1-\lambda) p_2} \leq \lambda \kldiv {q_1}{ p_1} +
%joe9
			%                (1-\lambda) \kldiv{q_2}{p_2} \]
							(1-\lambda) \kldiv{q_2}{p_2}. \] 
%joe9
%		Choose any edge $L \in \Ed$ from $A$ to $B$, and also
			%                any $a \in \mathcal V(A)$.
Given an edge $L \in \Ed$ from $A$ to $B$ and $a \in \mathcal V(A)$,
and   
%oli11
% etting $q_1 = q_2 = \bp(a)$, we get that
setting $q_1 = q_2 = \bp(a)$, we get that
	\[ \thickD(\bp(a) \ ||\ \lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda) p_2)
			\leq \lambda \thickD (\bp(a) \ ||\ p_1) + (1-\lambda)
%joe9
			%                \thickD(\bp(a)\ ||\ p_2) \]
							\thickD(\bp(a)\ ||\ p_2). \] 
	Since this is true for every $a$ and edge, we can take
		   a weighted sum of these inequalities for each $a$
%joe9
		   %               weighted by $p(A=a)$, and therefore
		   weighted by $p(A=a)$; thus, 
%oli11: I think the NeurIPS style guide wants us to avoid
% the TeX primitive $$, in favor of \[, as this behavior can be styled, while the TeX primitve cannot. 
	\begin{align*}
		\Ex_{a\sim p_A} \kldiv{\bp(a)}{\lambda p_1 +
			(1-\lambda) p_2} &\leq 
			 \Ex_{a\sim p_A}\lambda \kldiv {\bp(a)}{p_1} +

%oli11: reinstated intertext and deleted ``$$ and $$''
%oli11 removing "and so" breaks flow of equantions; replace with \implies
		% \intertext{and so,}
%joe14: you shuld use the logical implication symbol in the middle of a proof
%like this.
%oli16: I assume you meant to say "should not". Why is that? The
%symbol is universal, and the words break up the alignment of the
%equations, which helps 
% me see visually what changes were made. The words are also longer,
%causing a more 
% spread-out proof; the words themselves do not carry any extra meaning. It also
% visually simplifies the proof, and I put enough space and use the long versions,
% (instead of \Rightarrow / \Leftarrow), which are very rarely used as formal
% connectives in a language. In any case, this is not even a setting where 
% there could be any confusion between semantics and syntax. 
%
% This is likely to be a place where we have differing sensibilities. I would
% like to be convinced that your way of doing things is better, but as you can
% see, I have a lot of reasons that I dislike this stylistically. Do you have an
% argument that you think could persuade me? If not, the resulting compromise
% below might be the worst of both worlds (display mode equations that you are
% not a fan of, broken up with text in a way that reduces the visual benefit of
% displaymode equations for me, and expands the proof in a way that neither of
% us are happy with).
%joe15: I typically reserve logical symbols for logical expressions.
%It is fairly standard rule, although I'm not going to hunt down a
%reference.  I actully found it hard to distinguish the logical =>
%from the equations, so it made things worse for me.
%oli16: In any case, I'm updating  your change so that it displays
%properly with an intertext. I'm  
% not sure why you don't like "intertext" in general, but perhaps
%\shortintertext 
% gives you what you're looking for?
%joe15: I've never used \interext.  My concern is that it encourages
%you to write a lot of math (equations interspersed with a bit of
%text) rather than English.  I'm also getting lots of latex errors
%that I don't know how to fix.

\end{align*}
	The first term, 
	\( \Ex_{x,y \sim \mu_{\!_{XY}}} \left[-\log {\bp(y\mid x)}\right] \) 
	is linear in $\mu$, as $\bp(y\mid x)$ does not depend on $\mu$. %joe9: you need a reference here.  
As for the second term, it is well-known that KL divergence is convex, in the sense that 
	\[ \kldiv{\lambda q_1 + (1-\lambda) q_2 }{ \lambda p_1 +
          (1-\lambda) p_2} \leq \lambda \kldiv {q_1}{ p_1} +
%joe14
        %        (1-\lambda) \kldiv{q_2}{p_2} \]
                (1-\lambda) \kldiv{q_2}{p_2}. \] 
	Therefore, for a distribution on $Y$, setting $p_1 =
%joe9
%                p_2 = \bp(x)$, we discover that for any two
%               conditional marginals $\mu_1(Y \mid X=x)$ and
			%                $\mu_2(Y\mid X=x)$,that
 p_2 = \bp(x)$, for all conditional marginals $\mu_1(Y \mid X=x)$ and
			$\mu_2(Y\mid X=x)$,
	\[ \kldiv{\lambda \mu_1(Y\mid x) + (1-\lambda)
			  \mu_2(Y\mid x) }{ \bp(x) } \leq \lambda \kldiv
			   {\mu_1(Y\mid x)}{\bp(x)} + (1-\lambda)
%joe9
			   %                   \kldiv{\mu_2(Y\mid x)}{\bp(x)} \]
								  \kldiv{\mu_2(Y\mid x)}{\bp(x)}. \] 
	So $\kldiv*{\mu(Y\mid x)}{\bp( x)}$ is convex. As
			convex combinations of convex functions are convex,
			the second term, $\Ex_{x\sim\mu_X}\kldiv*{\mu(Y\mid
			  x)}{\bp( x)}$, is convex.
%joe9: we need a reference
%                Finally, negative entorpy is 1-strongly convex, by
			%                (\Cref{prop:neg-ent-convex}).
Finally, negative entropy is well known to be strictly convex.                

%joe10: what is this adding

%                positive coefficient $\gamma$ to the negative entropy,
%                it must be $\gamma$-strongly convex. Therefore, so
%                long as $(\beta_L \geq \gamma)$ for every $L \in

			it must be strictly convex. Therefore, as

			\Ed^{\dg M}$, $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ is
%joe9
%                $\gamma$-strongly convex, and in particular, strictly
strictly convex.  The result follows.

 $\lim\limits_{\gamma\to0}\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^* \subseteq \bbr{\dg M}_0^*$.

%oli12: ... it turns out you maybe can't do it this way?

%oli12 generalizing your proof.
% Suppose that $\bbr{\dg M}^* = \{\mu^*\}$ and 
% that $\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma = 
% \{\mu_\gamma\}$.  By the argument above, $\mu_\gamma \rightarrow
% \mu^*$.
% Choose any $\mu^* \in \lim_{\gamma\to0}\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$. By the definition 
% of this limit, we must have a sequence $(\gamma_i, \mu_i)$ such that $\gamma_i\to0$ 
% and $\mu_i\to\mu^*$, with each $\mu_i \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_{\gamma_i}$.
% %
% Since $\bbr{\dg M }_\gamma$ is clearly continuous as a function of
% $\gamma$, it follows that $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma  (\mu_\gamma)
% \rightarrow \bbr{\dg M}_0(\mu^*)$.  

Since $\IDef{\dg M}$ is a finite sum of entropies

Thus, there exist bounds $k$ and $K$ depending only on $\N^{\dg M}$ and
$\V^{\dg M}$, such that $\lb \leq \IDef{\dg M}(\mu) \leq \ub$ for all $\mu$.
%
%oli12: added reasoning
Since $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma = \Inc_{\dg M} + \gamma \IDef{\dg M}$,
it follows that, for all $\mu \in \V(\dg M)$, we have
%oli12: change to display mode
\[ \Inc_{\dg M}( \mu) + \gamma\lb \leq~ \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu) 
\leq~  \Inc_{\dg M}( \mu) + \gamma\ub. \]
%joe10: added instead
%oli12: This bit is garbled; the antecedents are all wrong, as "this minimum"
%must refer to [[M]], not Inc, and it's also not clear why "the minimum is
%achieved" results in the particular sequence \mu_gamma that you had before....
%I rewrote it more carefully.
%oli12: This next bit is actually tricky. slowing down.
For any fixed $\gamma$, since this inequality holds for all $\mu$, and
%joe14
%both $\Inc$ and $\IDef{}$ are bounded below, it must be true that
both $\Inc$ and $\IDef{}$ are bounded below, it must be the case that

\min_{\mu \in \Delta\V(\dg M)} \Big[ \Inc_{\dg M}( \mu) + \gamma\ub
    \Big], \] 
even though the distributions that minimize each expression will in general be different.
Let $\Inc(\dg M) = \min_{\mu} \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$.
%joe14
%Since $\Delta\V(\dg M)$ is compact, this minimum of the middle term is
Since $\Delta\V(\dg M)$ is compact, the minimum of the middle term is
achieved.  
Therefore, for any $\mu_\gamma \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma(\mu)$ that minimizes it, we have
%oli12: a little ambiguous about which minimum we're taking... removed.
% Taking the minimum over $\Delta\V(\dg M)$, we get that
$$\Inc(\dg M) +\gamma \lb \le \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu_\gamma) \le
		 \Inc(\dg M) +\gamma \ub$$ for all $\gamma \ge 0.$
% $$\Inc(\dg M) +\gamma \lb \le \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu_\gamma) \le$$
Now taking the limit as $\gamma\rightarrow 0$ from above, we get that
$\Inc(\dg M) = \bbr{\dg M }_0(\mu^*)$.
%joe10* You missed the punchline, which I just added
Thus, $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}_0^*$, as desired.

%joe14: we're not proving uniqueness of anything.  Lots more minor changes

%oli16*: ?? I'm confused. Isn't the entire point to show that there's a unique

%Therefore, there are subsequences sequences $(\mu_n)$ and $(\mu'_n)$,

Now, suppose that $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ distinct. Since $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$

%oli16: good catch
Because $\Inc$ itself is convex and $\Inc_{\dg M}(\nu_1) = \Inc_{\dg

it must be the case that $\IDef{\dg M}(\nu_3) < \IDef{\dg M}(\nu_1)$. 
        
% We now repeat the same argument.
%joe14: it's not clear what technique you're referring
% We repeat the same technique.  Because $(\mu_k) \to \nu_1$ must be some

%\IDef{\dg M}(\nu_3)$. But this means that for all such $k$ and for all
We can now get a contradiction by applying the same argument as that used to show
that $\IDef{\dg M}(\nu_1) =\IDef{\dg M}(\nu_2)$.

    $i^*$ such that for all $i > i^*$, we have $\IDef{\dg M}(\mu_{i}) >
    \IDef{\dg M}(\nu_3)$. Thus, for all $i > i^*$ and all
    $\gamma > 0$,

again contradicting the assumption that $\mu_{i}$ minimizes
$\bbr{\dg M}_{\gamma_{i}}$.
%joe14
%As a result, no such $\nu_3$
%exists, which by strict convexity, can only occur if $\nu_1 = \nu_2$.
%Therefore $\lim_{\gamma \to 0}\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ cannot
%contain two distinct elements.
%oli16*: The jump to the next sentence is really not clear to me. Where does
% the contradiction take us? I see what I wrote above as a neat summary of the
% argument and what actually happens when you unwind this contradiction. It 
% makes it way easier for me to read this passage. What happened when you read it?
% Did you  think, "unnecessary"? Did you understand the intention?
% 
% Aside: @communication: one of the most aggrivating things is when you delete
% things that I added on purpose, reverting changes I spent a lot of time
% trying to get just right, and then give no justification. 
% I suspect this works better when people write more quickly and
% think less hard about what they are writing than I do.
%
    % Thus, we must have $\nu_1 = \nu_2$, and 
%oli16: a very short version of what I had before.
Thus, our supposition that $\nu_1$ was distinct from $\nu_2$ cannot hold, and so
$\lim_{\gamma \to 0}\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ must be a singleton, as desired.
%joe14
%Combined with the fact that it is
%non-empty, $\lim_{\gamma \to 0}\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ must be a
%singleton for every choice of $\dg M$.

%joe10: you need a story ...
%oli12*: I have not been updating this proof at all because I'm 100% sure it works out, and we have a few extra days to get the appendix in order. I am aware that it desereves dramatic adjustments (esp. simplifications) to bring it in line with the main document, but I am not at all worried.
In this section, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:bns-are-pdgs}.  
%oli15:
We start by recounting some standard results and notation, all of
which can be found in a standard introduction to information
%joe14
%theory, such as chapter one of MacKay \cite{mackay2003information}.
theory (e.g., \cite[Chapter 1]{mackay2003information}).  

%oli16: adding so that we don't have to deal with bold face anymore...
%oli16: With your rewrite, we still didn't define the joint entropy (which is
%   I don't think is necessary because the word "joint" makes it clear), but 
%   use the symbols.  This succinctly fixes a lot of problems.
%oli16: note that we cannot replace "collection" with "set" because it
% must be able to handle duplicates.
First, note that just as we introduced new variables to model joint dependence
in PDGs, we can view a finite collection $\mathcal X=X_1, \ldots, X_n$ of random
variables, where each $X_i$ has the same sample space, as itself a random
variable% %($\V({\bf X}) = \V(X_1) \times \ldots \times \V(X_n)$)
, taking the value $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ iff each $X_i$ takes the value $x_i$.
Doing so allows us to avoid cumbersome and ultimately irrelevant notation which treats sets of raomd variables differently, and requires lots of unnecessary braces, bold face, and uniqueness issues. 
Note the notational convention that the joint variable $X,Y$ may be indicated by a comma.

\begin{defn}[Conditional Independence]\label{defn:cond-indep}
%joe14: it's standard to use boldface for sets of random variables,
%and italics for indiviual variables 
%oli16: I know the standard, and chose non-bold on purpose. 
% I think it is a mistake to make (and especially to emphasize notationally) 
% the distinction between a set of variables and a variable itself when dealing
% with PDGs, when writing general definitions that fare equally well for both,
% because identity can quickly get 
% confusing. For instance, a duplicate variable may be
% included as a node of a PDG (X, X'), and the set {X, X'} might be equivalent to
% { X } if we don't formally include labels. 
%
% My personal preference would be to drop the "sets of" and simply note that a
% set of random variables is itself a random variable. This way there is also 
% no ambiguity between the set { X, Y } and the node X \times Y 
  %%joe15*: The problem is that you use the notation when X, Y, and Z
  %are sets.  So if you're not go to define it for sets (which, as you
  %observed yourself, is the standard, as is the boldface notation),
  %then at a minimum, you have to say that these defintions also apply
  %when X, Y, and Z are sets, and explain what conditional
  %independence means for sets.  There's a reason why the use of sets
  %and boldface is standard.  It's generally a bad idea not to go with
  %standard notation.  If you're not going to do it, you *must* say so
  %and explain why to the reader.
%oli17: I believe I have explained this; let me know if you disagree.
%joe16: I meant ``explain in the text''.  if you did so, let me know where.
 %oli17: I also think the boldface is not as standard in recent papers, for some
% of the reasons I mention below. You say that we have to now separately define
% conditional independence for sets when we use it. I think that the exact
% opposite propblem happens if you only  describe it for sets: you then have to
% deal with how you consider a single variable a spceial case of a set. For us,
% this will be very confusing. Example: for your modified construction that
% turns a BN into a PDG, for[X -> Y], the construction creates a "new" node,
% \Pa(Y), equal to  { X }, and add projection edge { X } -> X. But if we
% consider X = { X }, we have created some ambiguity about the formal details. 
%joe16: we can debate what's more confusing (although I'd rather
% not).  But what is not open to debate is that we have to explain it.
%oli16 Of course, none of this matters very much here because
% conditional independence is not 
% affected by this choice, and this is standard, but I would be unhappy if 
% this notational convention were to sneak into discussion of PDGs -- therefore
% we do not have a shot of universally abiding by the convention anyway, and 
% bold letters are harder to type. 
%
%oli16: After coming back to this, I have decided that because I also do not
% want to be typing " { X } \CI { Y } " if X and Y are just variables and not
% sets of them, and I would rather have an adapter that treats a set like a
% random variable, than a lone variable likea  singleton set, I am deleting the
  % boldface.
%joe16: I don't know what you mean by ``an adapter''

  % If ${\bf X}$, ${\bf Y}$, and ${\bf Z}$ are sets of random variables,

    %	then $X$ is \emph{conditionally independent of $Z$ given $Y$}

%        notation,  
%	\[ \mu(X=x\mid Y=y)\mu(Z=z\mid Y=y) = \mu(X=x,Z=z \mid Y=y). \]
%	To indicate that this is the case, we write ``$X \CI_\mu Z \mid Y$''.
        have $\mu({ x} \mid { y}) \mu({ z} \mid { y}) =
        \mu({ x,z} \mid { y})$.
\end{defn}

%oli16*: You added the sentence below. If we want to say this, we need
%to say it WAY  
% earlier, because this is all over both the main body of the paper, and also
% appears in several proofs before this point!
%oli16: I'm also deleting it.
% If ${\bf X}$ is a set of random variables, we take $H_\mu({\bf X})$ to be $H(\mu_{\bf X})$. 
%oli16: I started adding this but realized that the marginal notation is not
% defined for sets, and we have actually defined
% We take $\H_\mu(\mathcal X)$ to be $\H(\mu_{})$
%joe15: I would be happy to say it earlier ...
%oli17: We introduce H(Y | X) and H(X) in the IDef paragraph. This
%discussion seems 
% like a bigger distraction there (given that most computer scientists know 
% at least a little about entropy), but we should do it before then.
%joe16: We should define them where they're first used
%oli16*: I'm changing the definition of entropy for single
%variables. There's no 
%reason to throw  the word "set" in and use heavy bold-face notation. It doesn't
%even buy you generality, because a "set of random variables" is just. It just
%confuses the type signatures. The standard presentation of entropy is in terms
%of single variables.  
\begin{fact}[Entropy Chain Rule]\label{fact:entropy-chain-rule}
%joe14: you have to define joint entropy
%oli16: fine I'll say "joint variable"
% If $X,Y$ are random variables, then the joint entropy
    If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, then the entropy of the joint
%joe15: if you insist on using the (somewhat nonstandard) terminology:
    %    variable $X,Y$ can be written as $\H_\mu(X,Y) =
%oli17: I would prefer not to have parentheses, as it 
% suggests that one should possible write 5 variables 
% as (((X,Y),(Z, W)),U), and the joint entropy H((X,Y)) with two sets of
% parentheses.
% Also, when we say "X1,X2,X2,....", neither of us use parentheses. Why should the 
    % case of n=2 be different?
%joe16: you can't write ``the joint variable X,Y'' without parens.
%That seems strange.
   variable $(X,Y)$ can be written as $\H_\mu(X,Y) = 
\H_\mu( Y \mid X) + \H_\mu(X)$.
%oli16: reverting; I want to define it for X, not {X}, and we've already
% named the result in the title; there's no reason to repeat those words 
% and use "says that", which I think is sloppier.
    %  The \emph{entropy chain rule} says that
    % $H_\mu({\bf X}, {\bf Y}) =   \H_\mu({\bf Y} \mid
    %     {\bf X}) + \H_\mu({\bf X})$. 
It follows that if $\mu$ is a
       distribution over the $n$ variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$,  then
%        expressions; for $n$ variables, $X_1, \ldots, X_n$,  
	\[ \H(\mu) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \H_\mu(X_i \mid X_1, \ldots X_{i-1}). \]
\end{fact}
%oli16: the fact you promoted to a definition in the "properties of conditional
% mutual information" fact is not a standard definition, and does not emphasize the symmetry... I therefore define it here properly.

$\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$

%joe4*: 
%                \bigcup_{i=1}^n\{ \Pa(X_i) \}$ to be the set of all of
%                the BN's variables, plus a new variable for each
 %         collection of parents, if not already in the collection.
%oli5: This presentation is nicer than mine, but unfortuantely doesn't
%work for technical reasons: 
% First, we need the union to collapse identical values of parent sets, and second, we want to collapse
% singleton parents to their values (which my original formulation did
%not do either, but can be fixed by using \{\{X_1\}, \ldots, \{X_n\}
%\} instead of \{X_1, \ldots, X_n \}).  
%joe5: I think that mh presentation should work fine, with minor
%modifications, that I suspect will lead to something simpler than
%yours.  Let's discuss.
%oli5: If these symbols are fresh, then they are distinct, forcing
%$|\V(\PDGof{\mathcal B})| = 2 * |\V(\mathcal B)|$. which is
							%unfortuantely not what we want.
%joe5*: \Pa(X_i), by definition, is a set of variables, not a
%variable.  It's *not*, as you say below, a variable ``coresponding'' to the
%parents of X_i.  That's why you need the Pa_i notation.  I can
%understand that you want to identify two variables that correspond to
%the same set.  So perhaps the right thing to do is to have variables
%Y_{\Pa(X_i)}:  i \in {1, ..., n}, |Pa(X_i)| > 1}.  You can point out
%that if Pa(X_i) = 
%Pa(X_j), then Y_{Pa(X_i)} and Y_{Pa(X_j)} are the same variable and
%that if  Pa(X_i) = X_j (so |Pa(X_i)| = 1) then we identify
%Y_{Pa(X_i)} with X_j.

%of distinct elements.

.  (This will be used to deal with the hyperedges.) 
%oli5: No longer necesary to mention explicitly.
%joe5: I disagree; see above.
% 	For simplicity, we can identify $\Pa(X_i)$ with the unique parent of $X_i$ if $X_i$ has only one parent;
%oli5: This already happens automatically.
% if $X_i$ has no parents, then we can take $\Pa(X_i) = \emptyset$ to

%oli5: added
(i.e., $\V^{\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}}(\{X_i\}) := \V(X_i)$)
%joe4: This is where the extended \V notation that I mentioned when
%you first defined \V would come in useful
%                and $\V(\Pa(X_i))$ is defind on
			%               sets as above.
%oli5: The shorthand confuses the two definitions of \V(set of
%vars). They conincide for good reason, but I don't want to even get
			%into this by using the shorthand here.
%joe5: what two definitions?                  
%	and $\V(\Pa_i) = \V(\Pa(X_i))$ 
and $\V^{\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}}(\Pa(X_i)) := \prod_{Y \in \Pa(X_i)} \V(Y)$
%oli5: This case does not require special attention, because there is
%a unique random variable $\sf 1$ which takes one value, and the
%cartesian product of zero sets. This makes the definition feel
	%cleaner to me.

% We start by giving this quantity a name. Let's call it $\tilde H$.

%joe9
			%		&= \kldiv{\mu_{_{XYZ}}}{q}

\end{align*}
where $\mu_{_{XYZ}}$ is the marginal of $\mu$ on the settings of $XYZ$, and $\kldiv{\mu_{_{XYZ}}}{q}$ is the relative entropy to $\mu_{_{XYZ}}$ from $q$. By Gibbs' inequality (non-negativity of relative entropy), $\tilde H$ is  (1) non-negative, and (2) equal to zero if and only if $\mu_{_{XYZ}} = q$, meaning that 
\[  \mu(x,y,z) =\begin{cases} \frac{\mu(x,y)\ \mu(y,z)}{\mu(y)} & \text{if }\mu(y) > 0\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \qquad \implies \qquad \mu(x,y,z) \mu(y) = \mu(x,y) \mu(y, z) \] 
and so $\tilde H_\mu(X \mid Y, Z)$ is (1) non-negative, and
	(2) equal to zero if and only if $X$ and $Z$ are independent

%\end{proof}
%oli15* new justification that was badly needed since we don't have the hyper-edge
% presentation anymore. I don't know if you want to add an \iota to the theorem
% statement or not, but this justification
Let $\mathcal X$ be the variables of some BN $\mathcal B$, and
$\mathcal M = \pdgvars$ 
be the PDG $\PDGof{\mathcal B}$.
%joe14*: I found the next few paragraph very hard to follow, although
%I knew what you wanted to say.  Shortened and simplified
%oli16*: I think this is not a point that we should gloss over; I find 
% your shortened version insufficient --- partly because it hides the fact that
% other distributions \mu on all of the variables are a priori possible. 
%joe15*: I strongly disagree.  Of course, other distributions are a
%priori possible, but for the purposes of this proof, we don't want to
%consider them.  I made it clear below that we're making the
%identification just for the purposes of the theorem.  I think that
%making a fuss about this (and, in particular, making \iota explicit)
%would only distract the reader.
%oli17: I agree that it's not necessarily a high-value thing for the
%average reader, 
% but I view it as an important technical underpinning that actually
% has a fair amount 
% of subltety (and I say this speaking as someone who wrestled with
% this point when 
% impelmenting PDGs).
%joe16: Not only is it not a high-value thing for the average reader,
%it has a *negative* value, because it distracts and confuses.  
%
%
% The only reason we can make this identification is the property of the
% scoring function I mentioned, which only occurs when we include the
% projection edges. Because we're making a claim about the scoring function, the
% other direction is less obvious. That's why I include talk of an injection and
% how everything outside of its image gets an infinite score. 
% This is a fundamental change that PDGs make; it reasults in some uglier
% explanations of joint variables, but I view it as the price you have to pay for
% technically eliminating the "set of parents". I think we should actually be
% more explicit with an \iota in the theorem statement as well.
%joe15: I could live with moving the paragraph below to the main text,
%but I dont think that adding the \iota is a good idea (and also
%wouldn't use the symbol iota in any case).  This is a matter of
%tradeoffs; if ou disagree, ask your friends.
%oli17: I agree with you that it's not a great use of space in the
%main text, for the  
% full paper, I like this idea. For the short paper, might it therefore be 
% reasonable to put it earlier in the appendix?
%joe16: This should ideally be mentioned the first time it arises,
%which is in the main text.  But, as you said, we might not have
%space.  Failing that, it should be said the first time that it
%appears in the appendix.  But that seems to be exactly where it is.
%Where would fit in earlier in the appendix?
\commentout{
We admit that in general, the set of variables
$\mathcal X$ is a strict subset of $\N$, and so a reader would be justifiably
suspicious of any claim (such as the one in \Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs}) in which a distribution over $\mathcal X$ is in a set of distributions over $\N$---the types do not work out. 

However, there is a natural injection $\iota: \Delta \V(\mathcal X) \to \Delta
\V(\mathcal Y)$, taking a joint distribution on the variables $\mathcal X$ and
returning the unique distribution on $\N$ for which the value of a node labeled
$X_1 \times \ldots \times X_n$ is always equal to the tuple of values on $X_1,
\ldots, X_n$. Technically, the statement of theorem should read
\[ \bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}^*_\gamma = \{ \iota \Pr\nolimits_{\mathcal B} \} . \]
Moreover, any distribution $\mu \in \Delta(\V(\N))$ that is not in the image of $\iota$, will have $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) = \infty$ (for all gamma), and so there is in fact a 1-1 correspondence 
\[ \Big\{ \nu \in \Delta\V(\mathcal X)~\Big|~ \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\iota\nu) < \infty \Big \} \quad\leftrightsquigarrow\quad 
\Big\{ \mu \in \Delta\V(\N)~\Big|~ \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) < \infty \Big \}.
\]
Therefore, from the perspective of scoring functions (and by
extension, all PDG semantics), the two spaces are equivalent. So long
as we refer only to the scores given by $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B}}$, we
may therefore conflate distributions from the two spaces,  which
justifies the statement of \Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs}, which we now
restate and prove.
}
Because the set  $\mathcal N$ of variables in $\PDGof{{\mathcal
    B},\beta}$ includes  
variables of the form $\Pa(X_i)$, it is a strict superset of
$\mathcal X = \{X_1,\ldots, X_n\}$, the set of variables of $\mathcal B$.
%joe15
%We can identify a distribution $\mu_{\mathcal X}$ over $\mathcal X$
For the purposes of this theorem, we identify a distribution
$\mu_{\mathcal X}$ over $\mathcal X$ 
with the unique distribution $\Pr_{\cal B}$ whose marginal on the
variables in $\mathcal X$ is $\mu_{\mathcal X}$ such that if $X_j \in
\Pa(X_i)$, then 
$\mu_{\mathcal N}(X_j = x_j' \mid \Pa(X_i) = (\ldots, x_j,\ldots)) =
1$ iff $x_j = x_j'$.  In the argument below, we abuse notation,
dropping the the subscripts $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal N$ on a
distribution $\mu$.

%oli15 added paragraphs:
%oli15: (note that my use of PDGof here, which I like because it

  %confusing with your notation.)
%joe14: I don't see why.  The next line is unnecessary, so I've
%already introduced the notation.
%As before, let $\mathcal X = X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be the variables of $\cal B$.
%joe14:  changing \Pr to \mu throught this proof
%oli16***: NOOOOOOOOO! \mu_{sub} is the marginal of the arbitrary
%distribution \mu on  
% the variables {sub}! I absolutely insist that we do not name
%anything that does 
% not depend on the candidate distribution \mu, with the letter
%\mu. This is VERY 
% important to my sanity. Why is this even a change you wanted to
%make? \Pr matches 
% with our notation for  probability of a factor graph as well... reverting.
%joe15*: We clearly have different sensibilities here.  I strongly
%object to using both \mu and \Pr to denote distributions.  Either use
%variants of \mu throughout or use variants of \Pr throughout.   I can
%live viewing \nu as avariant of \mu. The problem isn't that you kept
%it as a different letter, but that you used completely different
%notation for the same kind of object.  This becomes particularly
%egregious in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, where you have both Pr and \mu.
%oli17: Though they are the same kind of object, they are obtained in different
% ways. \mu are arbitrary distributions so we just need a fresh letter for them.
% Pr, on the other hand, is not a distribution, but a function, whch gives a 
  % distribution, represented by some data.
%joe16: Sorry, I'm lost.  In what way is Pr a function?  It sure looks
%like a distribution to me, you're treating it as one, and the
%notation  you're using (Pr) is the standard notation for a
%probability distribution.  
% This is also standard, and from 
  % this perspective, Pr and \mu are very different objects.
  %joe16: Sorry; that statement seems absurd to me.
%oli17: I'm curous: would you say it's acceptable to have [[M]]^* be a 
% distribution, even though it has no \mu in it? 
%joe16: here's there a class of notation: THere's the notation that we
%use for distributions and the notation that we use for semantics.  It
%seems reasonable that, in this case, the notation for semantics
%should dominate.
  %oli17: Two potential resolutions:
% [1] Say "let \nu = Pr_{B}" at some point and then manipulate \nu. (it is
  %      important that \nu != \mu, our arbitrary distribution)
%joe16: that won't help, since I'm not happy about using Pr and \mu to
%both denote distributions.    
% [2] Use brackets, like with pdgs. let [B] be the distribution that B represents;
%      we can play with the weight and style of the brackets. This is harder to
%      read in my opinion, but will have the substantial notational benefit of
%      making BNs, factor graphs, and PDGs the same in terms of
%joe16: you could make a case for this (you should then use the same
%style of brackets that you do for M, but at the end of the day,
%you're going to want to talk about a distribution.
  %turning them into  distributions.
%oli17: Until we resolve the above, I will (without marking) turn
%every \mu_{\cal B} 
%      into $\Pr_{\cal B}$ so that they are easier to mass-replace.
%joe15: As a general rule, if you're going to use two different notations for
%the same kind of object, you have to explain why to the reader.  But
%I see no compelling reason to do this here.
% I kept it as a separate letter, very intentionally! 
%  For any cpd $p(X_i \mid \Pa(X_i))$ associated to a node $X_i$ in the
%quantitative Bayesian network $\cal B$, we know that $\Pr_{\cal B}(X_i
  For the cpd $p(X_i \mid \Pa(X_i))$ associated to a node $X_i$ in 
$\cal B$, we have that $\Pr_{\cal B}(X_i
\mid \Pa(X_i)) = p(X_i \mid \Pa(X_i))$.  
%joe14
%Also, for any node corresponding to $\Pa(X_i)$, and $X_j \in
%\Pa(X_i)$, we have $\iota(\Pr_{\cal B}) (X_j \mid \Pa(X_i) =
%\ldots,x_j,\ldots) = \delta_{x_j}$.
For all nodes $X_i$ in $\mathcal B$ and $X_j \in \Pa(X_i)$, 
by construcction, $\Pr_{\cal B}$, when viewed as a distribution on
$\mathcal N$, is also with the cpd on the edge from $\Pa(X_i)$ to
$X_j$.
%joe14: I found this hard to parse, even though I knew what you intended
%Because $\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}$ contains precisely the cpds of
%$\mathcal B$, plus projections that match $\iota\mu$ for any
%distribution $\mu$ over $\mathcal X$, we conclude that $\Pr_{\cal B}$
%matches every cpd in $\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}$. This is true for any
%$\beta$, as $\SD{\cdot}$ depends only on the cpds, and not the
%weights. Therefore, $\Pr_{\cal B}
Thus, $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is consistent with all the cpds in
$\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}$;
%joe14: added
so$\Inc_{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\Pr_{\cal B}) = 0$.
%joe14*: This is true, but not relevant to what we're tring to prove
%Since $\SD{\cdot}$ depends only on the cpds, and not the weights, it
%follows that $\Pr_{\cal B}  \in \SD{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}$. 
%oli15-end additions.

%joe14: added next sentence and moved up the discussion of what you
%called topooigical orderings
We next want to show  that $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\mu) \ge 0$ for all
distributions $\mu$.  To do this, we first need some definitions.
%joe14*: We've already named the variables X_1, ...,X_n. You don't get
%to rename them.  You can assume here that the are ordered in the
%right way, ut then you won't be able to to about topoligical
%orderings.   I rewrote this in a way that will make things easier later.
%and let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be an ordering of the variables in $\mathcal B$,
%such each node $X_i$ has parents $\Pa(X_i)$ with
%strictly smaller indices (we call such an ordering
%$\cal B$-topological). At least one $\cal
%B$-topological ordering is possible because the
Let $\rho$ be a permutation of $1, \ldots,  n$.  Define an order
$\prec_{\rho}$ by taking $j \prec_{\rho} i$ if $j$ precedes $i$ in the
permutation; that is, if 
$\rho^{-1}(j)$ < $\rho^{-1}(i)$. Say that a permutation is \emph{compatible with
%oli16
% $\mathcal B$} if $j \in \Pa_iX_i)$ implies $j \prec_{\rho} i$.   There
  $\mathcal B$} if $X_j \in \Pa(X_i)$ implies $j \prec_{\rho} i$.   There
is at least one permutation compatible with $\mathcal B$, since 
the graph underlying $\mathcal B$ is acyclic.
  
%joe14*: why are you restricting to distibutions that are compatible
%with M?  I think that this will cause problems later.  (See below.)
%Choose an arbitrary distribution $\mu$ over the
%variables that is 
%compatible with $\PDGof{\cal B}$ (i.e.,
%each cpd in $\cal B$ must agree with the
%conditional marginals of $\mu$).
Consider an arbitrary distribution $\mu$ over the variables in
$\mathcal X$ (which we also view as a distribution over the variables
in $\mathcal N$, as discussed above).

%		\textbf{Extending these independences to all variables.}
	% We claim that the following are equivalent:
	% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	% 	\item $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}} = 0$ \label{item:noextrainfo}
	% 	\item $X_i \CI X_j \mid \Pa(X_i)$  if $j  < i$ for some $\cal B$-topological ordering of the variables.\label{item:someorder}
	% 	\item $X_i \CI X_j \mid \Pa(X_i)$  if $j  < i$ for every $\cal B$-topological ordering of the variables.\label{item:allorders}
	% \end{enumerate}
	% We have just shown the equivalence of (\ref{item:noextrainfo}) and (\ref{item:someorder}). Now suppose 
	
	% The equivalence of \ref{item:noextrainfo} and \ref{item:someorder}
	%   easily follows, since if there were some topological sort for which the independence didn't hold, then your proof shows that $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(p) \ne 0$.
	% 

We have shown that, for any topological ordering on
the variables of $\cal B$, $\IDef{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) =
%joe9: the \CI symbol hasn't been defined (although most readers will
%know it, you should explain it).
%oli15: using my notation.
% 0$ if and only if, according to $\mu$,  each $X_i \CI
 0$ if and only if  each $X_i \CI_\mu
X_j \mid \Pa(X_i)$ for $j  < i$; we will refer to this
as $(\star)$. 
	
	Now, suppose $X_j$ were a non-descendent of $X_i$, with $j > i$. Because $X_j$ is not a descendent of $X_i$, we can construct a second toplogoical sort of the variables in $\cal B$, in which $\#(X_j) < \#(X_i)$, where $\#(X)$ is the index of $X$ in the new ordering. 
	We can obtain $\#$, for instance, by topologically sorting $X_j$ and its ancestors, and then adding the rest of the variables (which we call $\bf R$) in their original order. The concatination of these two is a valid topological sort because the ancestors of $X_j$ are topologicaly ordered, and the parents of each $X \in \bf R$ occur no later than before.
	
	
	With this new order, suppose that 
	$\IDef{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$.
	% $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$.
	By $(\star)$, since $\#(X_j) < \#(X_i)$, we know that $X_i \CI X_j \mid \Pa(X_i)$ according to $\mu$. Since this is true for an aribitrary $i$ and $j$ without changing the distribution $\mu$, we conclude that if
%oli15
	% $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$, 
	$\IDef{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$, 
	then $\mu$ makes \emph{every} variable $X_i$ independent of its non-descendents $X_j$, given its parents.
	Conversely, if every variable is independent of its non-descendents given its parents, then $\mu$ is the unique distribution determined by $\cal B$, and since each variable of $\cal B$ is independent of previous variables given the values of its parents,  we know by $(\star)$ that
%oli15
 	% $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$. 
	$\IDef{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$. 
	Therefore, if $\mathit{NonDesc}(X)$ is the set of non-descendents of $X$ according to $\mathcal B$, we have
%oli15 
% \[ \H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0 \qquad\iff\qquad X_i \CI X_j \mid \Pa(X_i) \] 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:idef-bn-indeps}
 	\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\mu) = 0 \quad\iff\quad X_i \CI_\mu X_j \mid \Pa(X_i) \quad\text{for all $X_i$ and $X_j \in \mathit{NonDesc}(X_i)$} 
\end{equation}
	% Conversely, if $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) \neq 0$, then by $\star$ it cannot be the case that in some order, every variable is independent of all previous variables given its parents, and so in every order, some variable is not independent of all previous variables given its parents.  

%oli15 updated argument	
	% Because $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is the unique distribution that satisfies both these
	% independences, we conclude that $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu) = 0$ if and only if
	% $\mu = \Pr_{\cal B}$. 	
	% As $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}}(\mu)$ is non-negative, $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is its unique minimizer. 
These independencies are exactly the ones prescribed by $\cal B$.
Because $\Pr_{\mathcal B}$ in particular satisfies them,
we have $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\Pr_{\cal B}) = 0$.
We also know that that $\Pr_{\cal B} \in \SD{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}$, for
every vector of weights $\beta$. By \Cref{prop:sd-is-zeroset},
$\Inc_{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\Pr_{\mathcal B}) = 0$. Therefore, for any
$\gamma \geq 0$, we have
\[ \bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}_\gamma(\Pr\nolimits_{\cal B})
	= \Inc_{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\Pr\nolimits_{\mathcal B}) + \gamma \cdot
	\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}(\Pr\nolimits_{\cal B}) = 0
\]
Both $\Inc_{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}$ and $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}$
are non-negative for every $\mu$, which is sufficient to show $\Pr_{\mathcal B}$
minimizes $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}_\gamma$ for all $\gamma \geq 0$. 

If $\gamma > 0$, we can ensure that $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is its \emph{unique} minimizer. For $\gamma > 0$, if $\bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}_\gamma(\mu) = 0$, then $\mu$ must have the came cpds as $\mathcal B$ (since $\Inc(\mu) = 0$) and also of the conditional independencies of $\mathcal B$ (by \eqref{eq:idef-bn-indeps} and the fact that $\IDef{}(\mu) = 0$).
% \bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}_\gamma
We therefore conclue that for any $\gamma\geq0$ and vector $\beta$ of weights, 
\[ \{ \Pr\nolimits_{\cal B} \} = \bbr{\PDGof{\mathcal B, \beta}}_\gamma^* .\]

% is the unique distribution that satisfies both these independences, 
% we conclude that $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\mu) = 0$ if and only if
% $\mu = \Pr_{\cal B}$. 	
% As $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B,\beta}}(\mu)$ is non-negative, $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is its unique minimizer. 
	
	% \textbf{v2. Uniqueness by strong convexity.}
	% Part (a) of Lemma~\ref{lem:bnmaxent-component} tells us that
	% $\H^{\PDGof{\mathcal B}}$ is a sum of strongly convex
	% functions, and hence strongly convex itself. Because the set
	% of distributions that are compatible with $\PDGof{\cal B}$
	% is convex (Lemma~\ref{lem:convex}), $\H^{\PDGof{\mathcal
	% B}}$ has a unique minimum $\mu^*$ on this set. At the same
	% time, the distribution $\Pr_{\cal B}$ described by $\cal B$
	% satisfies the independences from
	% Lemma~\ref{lem:bnmaxent-component}, so we must have
	% $\H^{\PDGof{\mathcal B}}(\Pr_{\cal B}) = 0$, and since
	% $\H^{\PDGof{\cal B}} \geq 0$ and  has a unique minimizer,
% $\Pr_{\cal B} = \mu^*$.
}
%joe14*: new proof
So suppose that $\mu \ne \Pr_{\cal B}$. 
%  Then $\mu$ must  have the same cpds as $\Pr_{\cal B}$, 
%oli17: "the same cpds" as a distribution? Rephrase:
%joe16: `` the mu''?
%Then the $\mu$ must also match each cpd of $\cal B$,
Then $\mu$ must also match each cpd of $\cal B$,
for otherwise $\Inc_{\PDGof{\mathcal B,
\beta}}(\mu) > 0$, and we are done.  
%oli17: added, to clarify this step
Because $\Pr_{\cal B}$ is the \emph{unique} distribution that matches the 
both the cpds and independencies of $\cal B$, $\mu$ must not have all of the 
independencies of $\cal B$. 
%oli17 (end addition)
Thus,
some variable $X_i$, $X_i$ is not independent of some nondescendant $X_j$ in
$\mathcal B$ with respect to $\mu$.  There must be some permutation
$\rho$ of the variables in $\mathcal X$ compatible with ${\mathcal B}$
such that $X_j \prec_{\rho} X_i$ (e.g., we can start with $X_j$ and
its ancestors, and then add the remaining variables appropriately).
Thus, it is not the case that $X_i$ is independent of $X_{\prec \rho,
  i}$, so by (\ref{eq:key}), $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal B}}(\mu) > 0$.
This completes the proof.

	Let $\{\phi_L\}_{L \in \Ed} := \Phi(\dg M)$ denote the

%oli16: Here is probably not the right place, so I agree with your edit.

% M}_\gamma(\mu) = \infty$ .
M_{\Phi,\kappa}}_\gamma(\mu) = \infty$ for every $\gamma$.
          Thus, a distribution that 
        has a finite score must match the constraints. Moreover, every
        such edge has an associated conditional entropy $\H(X_j \mid

        per-link terms can be safely ignored for these edges. 

%joe14: we've never defined Z_j, although I guess it's clear from context
%	Let $\mat p_J$ be the joint distribution $\frac{1}{Z_J}\phi_J$

% Let $\mat p_J$ be the distribution $\frac{1}{Z_J}\phi_J $over $X_J$. Then
Let $\mat p_J$ be the normalized distribution $\frac{1}{Z_J}\phi_J$ over $X_J$,
where $Z_J = \sum_{x_J} \phi_J(x_J)$ is the appropriate normalization constant. Then

%joe4: what's a local normalization?      
%oli5: we are required to normalize each cpd 1->X because they are
%distributions. It's local because it's done for each cpd, and these
%normalizations are unlikely to ultimately be compatible with the
%joint distributions on these variables.    
	Because each local normalization results in a local joint
			distribution $\bp[J] = \frac{1}{Z_J}
%joe4*: I'm confused.  What differs from what?  is this what you meant

			\phi_J$ on the variables associated with $J$, and these distributions differ from the original factors $\phi_J$ by only a multiplicative 
		   constant, the product of these locally normalized factors differs from the product of the factors by only a constant, and so 
	\[ \Pr\nolimits_F(\vec x) \propto \prod_{J \in \cal J} \phi_J(\vec x) \propto \prod_{J \in \cal J} \left(\frac{\phi_J(\vec x)}{Z_J}\right) \propto \Pr_{\Phi(\PDGof{F})}(\vec x) \]
	and since the two distributions are normalized, they must be equal.

	Sketch:  By Theorem 2 of their paper, the stationary point of this procedure is unique, and equal to the only distribution $p$ which both is consistent with the independece assumptions, and also the cpds.  A feq examples strongly suggest thte independece assumptions associated with this structure, are correctly encoded in $\IDef{\PDGof{\mathcal D}}$.

\vfull{
\section{Further Details on the Information Deficit}

%oli17: wrapping this in a vfull because the figure takes some time
% to compile; taking the paragraph with me b/c it references the figure. 
    The examples here are in reference to \Cref{fig:info-diagram}.
    \ref{subfig:justX-0}, \ref{subfig:justX-1}, and \ref{subfig:justX-2} show that adding edges makes distriutions more deterministic. 
    As each edge $\ed LXY$ corresponds to an assertion about the ability to determine $Y$ from $X$, this should make some sense.
    In particular, \ref{subfig:justX-2} can be justified by the fact that if you can determine X from two different random draws, the draws probably did not have much randomness in them. Thus we can qualitatively encode a double-headed arrow as two arrows, further justifying the notation.
    	%oli11: note that it does not matter for the semantics, because failing to meet the constraint imposed by a double-headed arrow will give infinite cost anyway, for any edge, as \beta > 0.
    %	
    Without any edges (e.g., \ref{subfig:justX-0},\ref{subfig:justXY}), the $G$-information rewards distributions with the most uncertainty. Each additional edge adds a penalty for a crescent, as when we move from \ref{subfig:justXY} to \ref{subfig:XtoY} to \ref{subfig:XY-cycle}.
    %
    Some graphs (\Cref{subfig:justX-1, subfig:1XY}) are \emph{universal}, in that every distribution gets the same score (so that score must be zero, beause this is the score a degenerate distribution gets). Such a graph has a structure such that \emph{any} distribution can be precisely encoded by the process in (b). 
    %	
    The $G$-information can also indicate independencies and conditional independencies, illustrated respectively in \ref{subfig:XYindep} and \ref{subfig:1XYZ}.

    So far all of the behaviors we have seen have been instances of entropy maximization / minimization, or independencies, but $G$-information captres more: for instance, if $G$ has cycles, as in \ref{subfig:XY-cycle} or \ref{subfig:XYZ-cycle}, the $G$-information prioritizes shared information between all variables. 

    In more complicated examples, where both penalties and rewards exist, we argue that the $G$-information still implicitly captures the qualitative structure. In \ref{subfig:XYZ-bichain}, $X$ and $Y$ determine one another, and $Z$ and $Y$ determine one another. It is clear that $X$ and $Z$ should be indpenedent given $Y$; it can also be argued that $Y$ should not have any randomness of its own (otherwise the draws from $X$ or $Z$ would likey not match one another) and that this structure suggests co-variation of all three variables.

	Illustrations of example graph information
    	  functions $\{ \IDef{G_i} \}$, drawn underneath their
    	  associated multigraphs $\{ G_i\}$. Each circle represents a
    	  variable; an area in the intersection of circles $\{C_j\}$
    	  but outside of circles $\{D_k\}$ corresponds to information
    	  that is shared between all $C_j$'s, but not in any
    	  $D_k$. Variation of a candidate distribution $\mu$ in a
    	  green area makes its qualitative fit better (according to
    	  $\IDef{}$), while variation in a red area makes its
    	  qualitative fit worse; grey is neutral. Only the boxed
    	  structures in blue, whose graph information functions can be
    	  seen as assertions of (conditional) independence, are
    	  expressible as BNs.
