\subsection{Deriving Standard Quantities from PDG semantics}
	
	Having given some semantics for PDGs in terms of joint distributions, and verified some elementary properties about it, we now further defend it by showing that standard statistical quantities of interest arise naturally by simpy considering the relevant underlying PDG. 
	
	\begin{prop}
		If $p_1$, and $p_2$ are distributions on the same variable $X$, the optimal distribution for PDG consisting of these two distributions is the geometric average of $p_1$ and $p_2$, weighted by the quantitative weights $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ given to $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. That is,
		
		\[ \bbr*{p_1 ^{\{\beta = \beta_1 \}} \bundle p_2 ^{\{\beta = \beta_2 \}}}^* \propto \Big(p^{\beta_1} \cdot q^{\beta_2}\Big)^{\frac{1}{\beta_1+\beta_2}} \]
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\dg M = p_1 ^{\{\beta = \beta_1 \}} \bundle p_2 ^{\{\beta = \beta_2 \}}$.
		By definition, 
		\begin{align*}
		 	\Inc_{\dg M} (\mu) &= \Ex_{x \sim \mu} \left[ \beta_1 \log \frac{\mu(x)}{p_1(x)} + \beta_2 \log \frac{\mu(x)}{p_2(x)} \right] \\
				&= \Ex_{x \sim \mu} \left[ \log \frac{\mu(x)^{\beta_1 + \beta_2}}{p_1(x)^{\beta_1}\cdot p_2(x)^{\beta_2}} \right] \\
				&= \Ex_{x \sim \mu} \left[ \log \frac{\mu(x)}{\Big( p_1(x)^{\beta_1}\cdot p_2(x)^{\beta_2} \Big)^{\frac{1}{\beta_1+\beta_2}}} \right] \\
				&= \kldiv*{\mu}{\Big( p_1^{\beta_1}\cdot p_2^{\beta_2} \Big)^{\frac{1}{\beta_1+\beta_2}}}
		\end{align*}
		which is uniquely minimized by the distribution
		\[ \mu^* = \frac1Z \Big( p_1^{\beta_1}\cdot p_2^{\beta_2} \Big)^{\frac{1}{\beta_1+\beta_2}} \]
		for some normalization constant $Z$. By \cref{prop:consist}, the best distribution in the quantitive limit must minimize $\Inc(\dg M)$, and so by Gibbs inequality we conclude that
		\[ \bbr{\dg M}^* \propto \Big(p^{\beta_1} \cdot q^{\beta_2}\Big)^{\frac{1}{\beta_1+\beta_2}}. \]
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{coro}
		If $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distributions on the same variable, then
		\[ \bbr{p_1 \bundle p_2 }^* \propto \sqrt{ p  q } \]
	\end{coro}
