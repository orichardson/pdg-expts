        A Note on Maximum Entropy
    \end{center}
    
    
    Suppose we have a parameterized family of distributions
    $\{ \Pr_\theta \in \Delta X \}_{\theta \in \Theta}$.

     \section{Extreme Points}
         
    One criticism of maximum entropy is the following.
    
    \begin{example}
        Consider a coin flip whose outcome is denoted $X$, and suppose we know only one fact: for certain, the coin is biased in such a way that its probability of landing heads is at least $0.6$.
        
        Now the maximum-entropy distribution on $X$, among those we consider possible, prescribes a probability of exactly $0.6$. 
        Of course, that is one of two extreme possibilities, and does not seem to adequately model our ignorance of the true value of the coin flip.  
    \end{example}
    
    However, I think this framing is unfair. 
    To even articulate the concern, we had to explictly introduce another 
    variable about which we were uncertain: the bias of the coin. Now, as a PDG the model looks like this:
    \[
        \begin{tikzpicture}[center base]
            \node[dpadded](B){$\mathit{Bias}$};
            \node[dpadded,right=1 of B](X){$X$};
            \draw[arr] (B) -- (X);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \]
    
    We know the conditional probability of $X$ given $\mathit{Bias}$ -- that's just the bias itself. Still, many joint distributions over $\mathit{Bias}$ and $X$ are possible; the maximum entropy one will certainly NOT have a marginal on $X$ of $0.6$.  
    
    
    In general: even if there is some distribution $\theta^*$ that maximizes entropy, even if it is by a wide margin, selecting it deterministically likely does not  entropy of the entire system, at least if the decision is part of it, because then there's no entropy in $\theta$. 
    Indeed,
    
    \[ \H(X, \Theta) = \H(\Theta) + \H(X | \Theta)
         = \H(\pi) + \Ex_{\theta \sim \pi} \H(\Pr_\theta) \]
         
         
    Note that this is nothing like a fixed utility:
