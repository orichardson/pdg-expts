        Adding Utilities to PDGs}
    
    \begin{defn}
        A \emph{Utility Dependency Graph (UDG)}  $\dg U = (\N, \V, \UEd, U, \lambda)$ is the utility analog of a PDG.  As before, $\N$ is a set of variables, and $\V(X)$ gives the set of possible values each $X \in \N$ can take. 
        Also as before, it has labeled edges $\UEd = \{ \ed {L}XY \} $. But instead of encoding cpds with confidences, they give utilities: for each edge $\ed LXY \in \UEd$, we have 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  a conditional utility function $U_L(Y|X)$%
                \footnote{Note: right now, this is just a joint utility function $U(X,Y)$ because of currying, unless we do something clever}%
            ;
            \item and a relative importance $\lambda_L$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{defn}
    
    Looking only at the utility side of this, we can score joint jutility functions $\mathbf U : \V(\dg {UM}) \to \mathbb R$ with the semantics
    
    \begin{equation}
        \bbr{\dg U} =
             \sum_{\ed LXY \in \UEd}\sum_{(x,y) \in \V(XY)} \lambda_L \Big( U(y|x) - \mathcal U \Big)
    \end{equation}
