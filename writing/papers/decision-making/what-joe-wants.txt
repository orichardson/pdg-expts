DO things the standard way, to compare with my approach.
"The standard way" := add utility to PDGs, in the way that you make decision diagrams.
This will also have the benefit of allowing me to capture that behavior as well.


Dispreference against:
 - non-standard things
 - negative exponentials
 
We need: clear examples
