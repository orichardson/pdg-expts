    \subsection*{Convex Relations}
    Let $\mat A = \{ A_1, \ldots, A_n \}$ be a set of sets, which we will call attributes.
    A convex relation $R(\mat A)$, or simply $R$,  is a function
        $R : \prod_{i=1}^n A_i \to [0,1]$.
    There are two two extremal relations, the zero relation and the one relation.
    Suppose $R$ and $S$ are convex relations over the same attributes $\mat A$. We can form new relations in a number of ways.
    % First, here are some 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{convex combination.} For $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we get a convex relation $(R : \alpha : S)(\mat A) := (1-\alpha) R(\mat A) + \alpha S(\mat A)$.
        % \item \textbf{.} More generally, if $\cal R = \{ R_1, \ldots, R_n\}$ is a set of convex relations with each $R_i \in \square A$ over the same attributes $A$, and $M : \mathcal R \to [0,1]$ is a convex relation on that set of relations, then 
        % \[
        %     \mathcal R ^{M} (A) := \sum_{i=1}^n R_i(A) M(R_i)
        % \]  
        \item \textbf{warping.} For $\gamma \ge 0$,  $R^\gamma(\mat A)$ is also a relation on $\mat A$.
        \item \textbf{multiplication.} $(R \cdot S)(\mat A) := R(\mat A) \cdot S(\mat A)$.
        \item \textbf{max.} $(R \land S)(\mat A) := \max \{ R(\mat A),  S(\mat A) \}$.
        \item \textbf{axis normalization.} for a subset $\mat B \subseteq \mat A$ of attributes, we can define ...
        
        \TODO
        
        % \begin{enumerate}
        %     \item \textit{(sum)} 
        %     \[
        %         R[\mat B] := 
        %     \]
        % \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    Let $\square \mat A$ denote the set of all convex relations on attributes $\mat A$. 
    
    % Here are some examples of convex relations.
    Lots of things can be represented as convex relations; here are a few. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item an ``ordinary'' relation $R(\mat A)$
        % is a subset of 
            % $A_1 \times \cdots\times A_n$, or a function 
            % $R : \prod_{i=1}^n A_i \to \{0,1\}$.
            can be viewed as the special case of a convex relation whose output is always zero or one, and not anything in between.
        \item a probability distribution $p(X)$ can be viewed as a convex relation on one attribute: the values $\V X$ that $X$ can take, with the special property that 
        $\sum_{x \in \V X}p(X) = 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{remark}
        % Some facts.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ordinary relations are invariant under warping. 
            \item the convex relations that are both ordinary relations and probability distributions are deterministic distributions.
            % \item 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{remark}

    \section{Formalism}
    The core idea is to provide a model in terms of two parts: a manifold $\Theta$
    of configurations and a language $\Phi$. 
    % a manifold $\Theta$ and $\Phi$. 
    The elements of $\Theta$ are states: think parameters, probability distributions, data, assignements to program variables, and so forth.
    Meanwhile, the elements of $\Phi$ are elements of elements

    \begin{defn}
        A \emph{commitment function} is a function
        \[
            F: \Theta \times \Phi \times [0,1] \to \Theta,
        \]
        % whose application we will compress by writing $F^c_\phi\theta$ instead of $F(\theta, \phi, c)$,
        satisfying the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep,label={CF\arabic*.}]
            \item $F$ is differentiable;
            % \item for all $\phi,\theta$, we have $F^0_\phi\theta = \theta$;
            \item for all $\phi$, the function $F^0_\phi : \Theta \to \Theta$ is the identity;
            \item for all $\phi$, the function $F^1_\phi : \Theta \to \Theta$ is idempotent.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{defn}
    
    
    
    \begin{defn}
        A \emph{commitment system}
         % $(\Theta, \Phi, \chi)$.
        is a set of runs, each of which has state $\theta(t)$ that could evolve in time,
        and a commitment $\chi(\phi, t)$ in each 
        
        Formally, a commitment system is a tuple 
        % $(\chi, \theta)$
        $(\mathcal R, \Theta, \Phi, \chi, \theta, f)$,
        where
        \begin{itemize}[]
            \item $\mathcal R$ is a set of possible runs.
            % to each $r \in \mathcal R$ of which is a 1-dimensional differentiable manifold $T_r$ of times associated to $r$ (that is, ). 
            % We write $(r,t) \in \mathcal R$ to refer to a run $r$ and a time $t \in T_r$.
            Let $\pts \mathcal R$ refer to the set of points $(r,t)$ such that $r \in \mathcal R$ and $t \in \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$.
            % and $t \in T_r$.            
            % In most cases, we are interested in 
            % Unless specified otherwise, we assume $T_r = \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$.
            \item $\Theta$ is a differentiable manifold of possible configurations.
            \item $\vartheta : \pts \mathcal R \to \Theta$ is a function that                describes the configuration $\vartheta(r,t)$ of the system at time $t$ in run $r$.
            \item
            % $\chi: (r: \mathcal R) \times T_r \times \Phi \to \mathbb R$
            $\chi: \pts \mathcal R \times \Phi \to [0,1]$
            is a convex relation between points and language; 
            the number $\chi(r, t, \phi) \in [0,1]$ represents the ``commitment'' of the system to the statement $\phi$ at time $t$ and run $r$.
            
            % \item
            %  $f: \Phi \to  \mathfrak X(\Theta)$ describes the dynamics of the system, 
            %  by assigning a vector field $f_\phi : \Theta \to T\Theta$ to each sentence of the language.
            \item $F : \Theta \time \Phi \times [0,1] \to \Theta$ is a commitment function.
        \end{itemize}
        Furthermore, we require that the configurations and commitments be compatible with the dynmamics.
        This amounts to requiring that,
        for each $(r,t) \in \pts \mathcal R$, 
            if $\chi(r,t,\phi) < 1$ for all $\phi \in \Phi$, then
        the configuration trajectory $t' \mapsto \vartheta(r,t')$ is continuously differentiable in $t'$ at $t'=t$, and
        \[
            \dot\vartheta(r,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \vartheta(r, t) = 
                % \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} \chi(r,t,\phi) f(\phi)(\vartheta(r,t))
                % \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} -\log (1 - \chi(r,t,\phi)) f_\phi(\vartheta(r,t)).
                \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} -\log (1 - \chi(r,t,\phi)) F'_\phi(\vartheta(r,t)).
                % \int_{\Phi} f(\chi()) \mathrm d\phi
        \]
        % for each $(r,t) \in \pts \mathcal R$, and 
        % \[
        %     \vartheta(r, t + \tau) =     
        %     % \dot\vartheta(r,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \vartheta(r, t) = 
        %     %     \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} -\log (1 - \chi(r,t,\phi)) f_\phi(\vartheta(r,t)).
        % \]
        Otherwise, if $\chi(r,t,\phi) = 1$, we require that
        $\displaystyle
            \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \vartheta(r,t+\epsilon) = 
                F^1_\phi(\vartheta(r,t))
        $.
        % the limit $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \vartheta(r,t+\epsilon)$ exists and is equal to
        % the 
        % \[
        %     \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \vartheta(r,t+\epsilon) = 
        %     % \vartheta(r,t) +   
        %     \lim_{\tau \to \infty}   \int_{}
        % \]
        
        % \begin{align*}
        %     \Big(
        %         \Omega,\quad
        %         \chi : \Omega \times T \times \Phi \to \mathbb R,\quad
        %         \theta : \Omega \times T \to \Theta, \quad
        %         F : \Phi \to \mathfrak X(\Theta)
        %     \Big) 
        % \end{align*}
        Since $\Theta$, $\mathcal R,$ and $\Phi$ are implicit in the type signatures of $\theta$ and $\chi$, we can refer to the system without loss of precision as via the triple $(\theta, \chi, F)$. 
    \end{defn}
    
    \begin{remark}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item 
            $(\Theta, F: \Theta \to \Theta^{})$ is a coalgebra for the signature $G_\Phi(-) := (-)^{\Phi \times [0,1]}$ of partial updates.
            \item $(\Phi, \iota : \mathrm{Exp} \Phi \to \Phi)$ is a algebra for the signature of expressions in the language $\Phi$. 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{remark}
    
    
    We now present two generic ways to describe a system: with an external supply of information, and by autonomous evolution. 
    
    \begin{defn}
        The \emph{controlled commitment system} 
        $\mathit{ControlSys}(F)$
        generated by a commitment function $F$ is the set  of all possible trajectories of configurations and commitments that are compatible with $F$. 
        Explicitly, $\mathcal R$ is given by
        \[
            \Big\{ (\theta_0, h) ~\Big|~  \theta_0 \in \Theta,~
                h : \Phi \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \to [0,1],~
                 \Big\}
        \]
        so that $\pts \mathcal R = \mathcal R \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$,
        and then define
        $\chi((\theta_0,h,t),\phi) := h(\phi, t)$,
        and 
        $\vartheta(\theta,h,-)$ to be the unique solution $\theta(t)$ to the ODE
        \[
            \theta(0) = \theta_0,
            \qquad \frac{\mathrm d\theta}{\mathrm d t} (t) = 
                \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} h(\phi, t) F'_\phi(\theta(t)).
        \]
        % \begin{align*}
            % \varphi(\phi,t)
        % \end{align*}
    \end{defn}
    
    If we know something about the control signal $\chi = h$, we can also restrict to subsystems generated by only a subset of possible 
    control signals $h$. For instance, we can look at the system 
    
    \begin{defn}
        The \emph{discretely controlled commitment system} generated by a commitment function $F$ is the subsystem of $\mathit{ControlSys}(F)$ in which the control signal $\chi$ either commits fully or not at all. 
        % 
        More formally, it consists of those runs $r = (\theta_0, h) \in \mathit{ControlSys}(F)$ such that, for all $t \ge 0$, and all $\phi$, $h(\phi, t) \in \{0,1\}$.        
        % there exists some $\phi^* \in \Phi$ such that
        % the commitment $\chi(r,t,\phi) = \mathbbm 1[ \phi = \phi^*]$.
    \end{defn}


    % 
    % \begin{remark}
    %     As a result
    % \end{remark}
    
    
    \begin{example}[probabilistic conditioning]
        Consider a measurable space $\mathcal X = (\Omega, \mathcal A)$ of outcomes, with a base measure $\lambda(X)$.
        Updating probabilistic by conditioning in response to new information may be described by a commitment system whose states $\Theta := \Delta \mathcal X$ are probability distributions, and whose language $\Phi = \mathcal A$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of events. 
        
        Now, fix any commitment function such that $F(A,\mu,1) = \mu | A$, such as the linear one 
        \[ 
            F(A, \mu, c) := 
             \begin{cases}
                (1-c) \mu + (c)\, \mu | A & \text{~if~} \mu(A) > 0 \\
                \mu & \text{~if~} \mu(A)=0
            \end{cases}
        \]
        Now, the discretely controlled commitment system generated by $F$ consists of all runs that begin with a distribution, and recieve events  
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}[factor graphs as commitment systems]
        Consider a factor graph 
        % with factors $f_1(X_1), \ldots, f_n(X_n)$. 
        $\{ f_j(\mat X_j) \}_{j \in J}$ over variables $\mathcal X = \cup_{j \in J} \mat X_j$. 
        The corresponding system has a run for all positive probability distributions $\mu_0 \in \Delta^{\!\!{+}\!} \mathcal X$, in which $\mu$ approaches the optimal proability, which is the solution to the ODE
        \begin{align*}
            \theta(0) = \mu_0;
                \qquad
