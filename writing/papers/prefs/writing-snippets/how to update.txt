Let's take our standard formalization at this point, where we have a graph, where the nodes represent cocnepts, and the directed edges are somehow semi-causal impacts of one on another. 

Preferenece revision at a specific nodes:
	- Is there a flow adjustement / local balancing thing to be done? 
	
	- Do local composition at a node. This is gluing (/cut elminiation?) which can be used instead of M.P. as an update rule. I.e. if you have p: A -> B, and q : B -> C, and also r: A -> C, then munge parameters so that [ q p = r ]
	
	- Local backward preference search at this node: use previous nodes as updatesj
	
	- Gradient descent of global inconsistency on local parameters.
