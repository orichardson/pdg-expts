Examples of Principal-Agent problems in economics:
	Teaching: reward research but hope for good teachers
	
	Incentivizing Wells Fargo employees to create accounts
	Incomplete Contracting: missing gaps, provisions, ambiguities.

System designer makes an assumption about a correlation [score <--> performance] or [exercise <--> step count], which might not exist. 

The approach given in this talk is to look at behavvior in training environments, and to use this extra data to estimate correlations between the "true reward function" and the one given (because it does exist in the test environments).

Note that this effectively is a redundant encoding of reward across multiple environments. 

?? What are the space of things you could care about ? In an MDP this is very large:


Decision Making and computational Complexity
	MDP <= PomDP
	Multi-agent MDP
	Dec-POMDP
	
	Dec-POMDP are NEXP-complet
	POMDP are PSPACE complete
