- Read CP (conditional preferences) paper.
- Searched papers which cite it; several are overview papers, some cite the algorithm.
- Reading about decision theory: Stanford encyclopedia is an excellent resource.
- Reading about Savage, evidential vs causal decision theory

Different kinds of things: preferences, utilities, desires. Savage: preferences + consistency => utilities + probabilities.


Trivial way of using meta-preferences as CP networks: have a prefernce node at the top, whose values are all possible preferences, and all nodes depend on it.
