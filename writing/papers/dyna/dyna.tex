\section{Introduction}
% In our first paper, we introduced PDGs, their semantics, and some examples.
% PDGs are able to represent an inconsistent collection of local beliefs; we have argued that doing so allows us to represent important states of knowledge, and hinted that it may allow us to make better decisions and
% save computation.

We have introduced PDGs, a powerful graphical model that subsume other graphical
models, such as factor graphs and Bayesian Networks. They are essentially 
collections of conditional probablity distributions (cpds), and have semantics in
terms of a distribution-scoring function.

But how can we use them to make predictions? What kinds of queries can we ask a
PDG? How does this interact with the distribution-scoring semantics? The answer
to these questions depends in part by the kind of queries we want to support.
For definiteness, suppose we have a PDG $\dg M$.

\begin{itemize}
  	\item Conditional Probability Queries $p(Y \mid X)$
	\item Queries
\end{itemize}
