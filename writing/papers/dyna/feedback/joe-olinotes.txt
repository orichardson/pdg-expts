JOE MEETING NOTES
	position PDGs relative to Bayesian Networks
	 
	Harness results lift from BNs
	 
	 
	If PDG is consistent, it must be the case that .... (to find countersexamples)
	 
	Use Farkas lemma. See 
	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089054019090060U
	For an example of how Joe used it. 

REVIEW OF SEMI-DRAFT
	2.3
	Briefly discuss what BN people do, 
	
	2.4
	Figure out if it fits into the story. 
	
	3
	Have to redo motivation. It's not a paper on variational inference. Have to motivate updating and 
	
	Could imagine a double-barreled story:
		inference in PDGs
		using pdgs to do inference in other formalisms

	AGENDA
		


	Comparably hard. Want the message to be: you can apply standard techniques, and they're of comparable difficulty. 
	

	present: three approaches in the ilterature.	
	Three approaches with clear analogues in other contexts. 

	New approach, very specific to PDGs. 	
	This algorithm will detect inconsistency!
	
	
	Start out by talking about conditioning & Jeffrey's rule to show inference involves adding edges and making inconsistent
	
	Highlight, in each case: the new issues that arise in PDGs. 
	
MAY 19 MEETING
	
	AXIOMS
		Sequence of algorithms, limiting to the brute force. Provide guidance
	
		
		Story: sequence of algorithms
		
		Algorithm K fails for k+1
