Section on Regularizers doesn't fit in.

	> Change story completely. 
	A simple story: people add regularizers to loss functions. 
	
	I didn't say: "I'm following the general policy of writing constants in gray"
	
	
	In rewrite "can be viewed as a justification of the correspondence between regularizer and prior". Don't even need to explain
	
	No paragraph in the introduction.
	Insead: "we can capture regularizers in a way that justifies a well-known connection between priors and regularizers".
	
	
	Two Big Stories, not brought out well-enough
		- (1) Universal
		- (2) The model-based view
		Too busy wheeling off theorems, not enough time talking about them. 
		
		Say a few more times: take a model-based view. This allows us to express the modeler's beliefs. Look at what it buys us. 
		
		This is the message you want to drive home.
		
	Font size too large?
