`confidence.tex` ::   main working file
`confidence-intro.tex` :: mostly intro, focused on doing things as Joe would like
`confidence-long.tex` :: comprehensive document ideally including the above + more, but not always up-to-date
`cuts.tex` :: where wrong or misguided material goes, which is always a distraction no matter the length. 

`trust.tex` ::  my own second spin on
