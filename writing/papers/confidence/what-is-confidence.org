#+TITLE: What Is Confidence?
#+subtitle: A (hopefully) evolving look at how I'm tackling the problem.

* The Setup.
You have belief states \Theta.

You then have a sequence of interactions, with the world and other people. Each interaction is decomposed as an element \phi \in \Phi and
a "confidence" \beta \in R


If we think of \Phi as a language of assertions, then \beta is
+ The "degree of confidence" in the assertion \phi imparted by the interaction
+

* Questions, for the presentation
** What characterizes the PDG update rule?
\tau : \nabla [ M ]_\gamma

* Questions I want to answer, for the Math
** What is the Fisher Information for \Theta = { PDGs } ?
*** Why worth answering?
Because it tells you how to do natural gradient descent.
