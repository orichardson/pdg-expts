What should it mean to say that one has a high degree of confidence in a statement $\phi$?  It is often taken to mean that we think $\phi$ is likely. 
% This paper details a different conception that arises when updating beliefs.

Here we argue that there is a related but more useful conception of confidence that arises when updating---one that complements likelihood and, moreover, unifies several different concepts in the literature.
% Here we argue that there is a related but more useful way of defining confidence, which complements notions like probability and, moreover, unifies several different concepts in the literature.

% For us, the degree of confidence in $\phi$ is a measure of the degree

% when updating beliefs.
%
%oli1: with reference to your rewrite (above): I don't like the way the grammar

% that you wrote. Let me try to clean it up. 
%
For us, confidence is a measure of \emph{trust}, rather than likelihood.
In particular, the {degree of confidence} that one has in a piece of information $\phi$
%is a number  $\chi \in [\bot,\top]$ that 
quantifies how seriously to take $\phi$ in updating one's beliefs.

% In the below, I replaced "0" and "1" with "no" and "full" because

% More importantly, the second part about "taking \phi to be true" doesn't
% make as much sense in general, so I rephrased it.
%
% Thus, if we learn $\phi$ but have confidence 0 in it, it should not
% affect our beliefs at all, while if we have confidence 1 in $\phi$, we
% should update our beliefs by taking $\phi$ to be true; in a

%
% Thus,
So at one extreme,
if we observe $\phi$ but have no confidence in it, 
% it should not affect our beliefs at all;
we should not change our beliefs at all;
at the other, if we have full confidence in $\phi$,
 we should fully incorporate it into our beliefs.

%oli1: changed from "the obvious way" to "an obvious way"

The converse is false, however, so
confidence and probability can be quite different.
% 
%oli1: the context here has been stripped; we're now missing how it might be possible to learn \phi with low confidence if we already assign it high probability.
% If we start out with a prior that gives $\phi$ high likelihood, and learn $\phi$ with low confidence, our posterior beliefs still give $\phi$ high likelihood.  
% We might also have a great deal of confidence in an observation of $\phi$  despite having a low prior belief in $\phi$.
If an untrusted source tells us $\phi$ which we already happen to believe, 
then our prior assigns $\phi$ high probability,
we learn $\phi$ with low confidence,
and our posterior beliefs still give $\phi$ high probability.

% Confidence is even easier to distinguish from prior probability: 
Confidence and prior probability are even more independent:

Consider a neural network, whose ``belief state'' is a setting of weights.

% As it sees each training point, it updates its weights. 
% Modern learning algorithms do not take any individual point too seriously; each training point $x$ changes the weights incrementally, and alone may not even be enough for the network to classify that point correctly.
%oli1:adding, per our discussion
For definiteness, suppose we are talking about a classifier, so that for every setting of weights $\theta$, there is a function
%oli1: I can also siplify this to be a function f : X \to [0,1] if it's
% a binary classifier, which will simplify the text. 
$f_\theta : X \to \Delta Y$ that maps inputs $x \in X$ to distributions $f_\theta(x)$ over possible class lables $Y$. 
%joe1*: You're going on a long digression here that's irrelevant.
%This is the opposite of "clean and crisp".  Just cut to the chase:
%what does confidence mean in this setting? What is it that gets
%confidence?  This is not the least bit clear to me from your
%writeup.  You say that we can quantify confidence by the number of
%training iterations, but I don't see how to relate that to having a
%high degree of confidence in \phi.  What's \phi?
%oli1*: what I said was all relevant and curated, but evidently it wasn't
% clear and I lost you pretty early on. I'm trying to fill out what I had
% so it's easier to follow.
Modern learning algorithms (like gradient descent) make small incremental changes to the weights.
Therefore, if we update $\theta$ with a labeled training example $\phi = (x,y)$ to obtain new weights $\theta'$, there is no guarantee that $f_{\theta'}(x)$ gives high probability to $y$---only that it will be higher than it was before.

(in contrast to their historical counterparts like conjunction learning algorithms \parencite{conjunctions}) 
do not take any one encounter with a training example too seriously---

\commentout{
	As a result,
	there is a significant difference between going through the training data once

	\unskip, and doing so many times.}
%oli1: paragraph break now that we have example structure to hold it together

Nevertheless, 
% the weights do eventually converge if we repeatedly train on $x$, 
if we train by repeatedly updating with the sample $\phi$, 
% which is a natural notion of

% full incorporation---%
the weights do eventually converge.%
	\footnote{Note for Joe: this is a white lie; the truth depends a bit on the architecture, and we may require that the space is compact. But this can be easily achieved by considering weights taking extended real values.}
% At the other extreme, if we had no trust in $x$, we could ignore it leaving our weights unchanged. 
% In this context, 
% Once again we have two extremes:
% Depending on our confidence, 
% How we ought to treat $x$ 
% What we ought to do depends on our confidence.
% At one extreme, we have no trust in $x$ and should ignore it, leaving weights unchanged; at the other, we trust $x$ completely, we should adopt the weights that arise in the limit of infinite training. 
% Moreover, this sequence of incremental updates (roughly) describes a path between the two extremes.%
%oli1: slowing down to fill out the story and explicitly bring out the connection to the other one
Doing so would be an extreme action, and only appropriate if we have complete trust in $\phi$, meaning we think important that $x$ always be classified as $y$.
At the opposite extreme, if we have no trust in $\phi$, we should simply discard it without changing our weights. 
Furthermore, our definition of a full-confidence update 
already suggests what to do for intermediate levels of confidence: simply stop the training process before convergence.
 % if we train with the sample $\phi$ but stop early,

%
If we fix some ``unit confidence'', say $\iota=0.01$,
then for any $n \in \mathbb N$,
sequentially performing $n$ updates of confidence $\iota$ is 
equivalent to a single one of confidence $\alpha= 1-(0.99)^n$.
% Therefore, confidence $\alpha$ corresponds to a sequence of

of confidence-$\iota$ updates to be performed in sequence.
% A natural number describing the number of incremental updates (as in  \cref{ex:classifier}) is in some ways less satisfying then a number between zero and one (as in \cref{ex:prob-simple});

	Thus, in contexts where a proportion of incorporation $\alpha\in[0,1]$ is meaningful,
	% effectively the only difference between the two ways of describing confidence is that the latter has a choice of scale.

Let $W$ be a finite set of possible worlds, 
and suppose our belief state is a 
% generalization of a probability over $W$ called a
% Dempster-Shafer belief function, 
% % which is a particular generalization of a finite probability measure,

Suppose we come accross evidence that supports an event $\phi 
\subseteq W$ to a degree $\alpha \in [0,1]$.
Together, $\phi$ and our confidence $\alpha$ in it
can be represented by another mass function $s$,
called a \emph{simple support function},
% that assigns $s(\phi) = \alpha$, $s(W) = 1-\alpha$ and $s(U) = 0$ for all other $U \subseteq W$.

% \end{cases}
% \]
%
To combine our prior belief $m$ with the new evidence $s$,
Shafer argues we should use Dempster's rule of combination,
% to obtain a posterior belief
to obtain a posterior $m' := m \oplus s$, 
given in this case by:
% which in this case equals
% a complicated-looking
% posterior 
% $m'$ whose value at each 
% % $\emptyset \ne$
% non-empty $B \subseteq W$ is:
 % $m'$ by:
% $ m'(B) := $
\begin{align*}
	% m' &:= m \oplus s \\[-1ex]
	% m'(U) &:= (m \oplus s)(U) \\[-0.5ex]
 	m'(U) &= 
	% =U &\mapsto
	% =\;&
	% &
	% \frac{1}{1\!-\!k} 
	% \sum_{\substack{U,V \mathrlap{\subseteq W} \\ U \cap V \mathrlap{= B}}}
	% 		m(U) s_{\!A}(V), ~~
	% \text{where}~~
	% k := \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{U,V \subseteq W \\ U \cap V = \emptyset}}}
	%  	m(u) s_{\!A}(V)
	% \\
	% %
	% &= 
	\frac{1}{\!\displaystyle 1 - \alpha \sum_{\mathclap{V \subseteq (W \setminus \phi)}} m(V)\!}
	\Big(
	(1-\alpha) m(U) + 
	\alpha \sum_{\substack{\mathclap{V \subseteq W} \\ \mathllap{V \cap \phi} = \mathrlap{U}}} m(V) 
		\Big).
\end{align*}
It is easy to verify that when $\alpha = 0$, the posterior beliefs are the same as the
prior ones, and that when $\alpha = 1$,
 % this has the effect of removing all 
% one effect is to discard the mass from sets
all mass is assigned to subsets of $\phi$.
It follows that, after the update, $\Bel_{m'}(\phi)$.

% 		& \text{otherwise}
% 	\end{cases}
% \]

% What if $m$ itself is a simple support function on $A$?
% When combining two simple support functions both on $A$, we might
% want to describe 
We now look at some special cases. Suppose that $\Bel_m$ is a probability 
measure $\Pr$, or equivalently, that $m$ only assigns mass to singletons.
% measure, meaning that gives mass only to singletons, then $m'$ is as well,
% measure $p$, meaning that $m(\{x\}) = p(\{x\})$ and $m(U) = 0$ when $U$ is not a singleton, then
% $m'$ is also a probability measure, and is given by:
Then $m'$ also only assigns mass to singletons, and is given by:
\begin{equation}
m'(\{x\}) =
 % \frac{\alpha \mathbbm1[x \in A] p(x) + (1-\alpha) p(x)}{1 - \alpha + \alpha p(A)}.
 % \frac{\alpha\; m(\{x\} \cap A) + (1-\alpha)\, m(\{x\})}{1 - \alpha + \alpha\; \sum_{y \in A} m(\{y\})}.
 % \frac{\alpha\; (\{x\} \cap A) + (1-\alpha)\, p(\{x\})}{1 - \alpha + \alpha\; p(A)}.
 \frac{\alpha\; \Pr(\{x\} \cap \phi) + (1-\alpha)\, \Pr(\{x\})}{1 - \alpha + \alpha\; \Pr(\phi)}.
\end{equation}
As a function of $\alpha \in [0,1]$, $m'$ is  
% a path that begins at $p$ and ends at $p|A$,
a path that begins at $\Pr$,  ends at $(\Pr |\phi)$,
and can even be viewed as a ``proportion of the way to incorporation'',
just like in \cref{ex:prob-simple}.
But it is parameterized differently.
Thus, we need more assumptions in order to pin down the
exact meaning of an intermediate confidence value.
In \cref{sec:loss-repr}, we will
develop tools we need to fully understand the relationship between
these two paths from $\Pr$ to $\Pr|\phi$, and the sense in which
each one is natural.


% We now turn to a second special case.
Alternatively, suppose that $m$ is not a probability but rather
another simple support function on $\phi$. 
Then so is $m' = m\oplus s$.

The meaning of $n$ in \cref{ex:classifier} depends on the learning algorithm,
the quantity in \eqref{eq:loglogiota} requires an irrelevant choice of $\iota$,
and the weight of evidence is only unique up to the constant $k$.
However, we will see in \cref{sec:vecrep} that insofar as there is an 
$\alpha$ with an objective meaning, there is also a natural additive 
scale for confidence: the unique one for which small values of $n$ and 
small values of $\alpha$ are indistinguishable, or equivalently,
the unique base for which derivatives of $\alpha$ and $n$ with respect
to one another (or any third quantity) are identical.
Thus, there is a special scale of additive confidence $n \in [0,\infty]$
for the same reason that there is natural base for exponentiation: 
% a special local indistinguishability from the identity.
% $e^x$ is indistinghishable from $1+x$ for small $x$. 
% a locally, there is only one base that looks like the identity. 
it is the only base whose differential at 0 is the identity. 
(Indeed in these simple cases, this amounts to taking $k = -\log e$ and $\iota = 1-\frac1e$ so that all logarithms are base $e$---but at a deeper level, this is a consequence of the uniqueness of the exponential map of the Lie algebra implicit in our framework.)
% The deeper reason is that there is a 
To summarize: there is a unique way to represent a confidence
$\alpha \in [0,1]$ as a confidence $\beta \in [0, \infty]$
such that the two scales behave identically when both are small. 
But the intuition behind additive confidence $\beta \in [0, \infty]$ 
generalizes past where the intuition for $\alpha \in [0,1]$ will take us.

\begin{example}\label{ex:jugo}
Jugo is an impartial juror.
Like the other jurors, she has two buttons in front of her.
The button labeled $\mathsf G$ increases the probability 
of a guilty verdict, while the button labeled $\mathsf N$ increases
the probability of a not-guilty verdict. 
In more detail: let $J$ be the number of jurors, and $G_j(t)$ be
a variable that is equal to one if juror $j \in \{0, \ldots, J\}$
is pressing the $\mathsf G$ button at time $t$, and zero otherwise; 
symmetrically, let $N_j(t)$ indicate whether $j$ is pressing the $\mathsf N$ at 
time $t$. The belief state of this automated system is
represented by a single number $g \in [0,1]$.
If any individual juror presses the $\mathsf G$ button, 
the system evoves according to $\frac{\mathrm dg}{\mathrm dt} = (1-g)$;
we call this the \emph{vector field} associated with the $\mathsf G$ button.
The total effect of all buttons is then the sum of that of all buttons across all vector fields, when they are active:
% in which case $g(t) = 1 + (g(0) - 1)e^{-t} $.
% Concretely, their dynamics are governed by:
\[
	\frac{\mathrm dg}{\mathrm dt} = 
	\sum_{j = 1}^J G_j(t) (1-g) 
		- g N_j(t)~,
	% \begin{cases}
	% 	(1 - p)	& \text{button $\uparrow$ pressed} \\
	% 	-p & \text{button $\downarrow$ pressed}
	% \end{cases}	
\]
so that $g$ exponentially approahces $1$ when more $\mathsf G$ buttons are pressed than $\mathsf N$ buttons,
and symmetricaly, exponentially approaches $0$ when more $\mathsf N$ buttons than $\mathsf G$ buttons are pressed.
At the end of the trial, the defendant is convicted with probability
equal to the final value of $g$. 

Let $\phi$ represent a piece of evidence suggesting guilt, presented by the
prosecution from time $t_1$ to time $t_2$,
and suppose for now that only buttons labeled $\mathsf G$ are pressed
in this interval.
% Many aspects of this scenario can be understood in terms of confidence.
%
	% The amount of time that 
	% What is the confidence of the system in that evidence, as it understands it from the Jurors?
% First, suppose that only $\mathsf G$ buttons are pressed
	 % between $t_1$ and $t_2$. 
% in between times $t_1$ and $t_2$.
The system measures $j$'s confidence in $\phi$ by
\[
	w_j := \!\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\!\! G_j(t) \mathrm d t 
	= \text{ total time $j$ presses $\mathsf G$ during $\phi$,}
\]
Note that $w_j = 0$ if and only if $j$ does not press any buttons,
which (a) indicates that $j$ does not trust the evidence $\phi$, 
and (b) communicates this fact to the system, by telling it to ignore 
the evidence. 
Note that this is an additive representation of confidence, since
pressing the button for four seconds, and then three more later, is
by definition the same as pressing it for seven. 
While the maximum possible confidence of $w_j$ is $(t_2 - t_1)$,
this system does not allow a juror to express \emph{full} confidence in $\phi$
because no finite amount of $\mathsf G$-pressing will result in a 
guilty verdict with probability one; it is always possible to increase
the value of $g$ through additional evidence. 

% Now, recall that ,
Altogether, the system's confidence in $\phi$ can be measured by
as the unique value $W$ for which
\begin{align*}
	% \int_{t_1}^{t_2} W (1-g(t)) \mathrm d t = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum_{j=1}^J G_j(t) (1-g(t)) \mathrm d t,
	\int_{t_1}^{t_2} W (1-g(t)) \mathrm d t =
	 g(t_2) - g(t_1),
	% \\
	% W = \frac{1}{t_2-t_1 - \int_{t_1}^{t_2}g(t) \mathrm dt} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sum_{j=1}^J G_j(t) (1-g(t)) \mathrm d t
\end{align*}
which, so long as only $\mathsf G$ buttons are pressed, equals
$W := \sum_{j} w_j$, so this measure of confidence is additive 
across jurors as well as across time. 
This is appropriate, since the jurors are independent and 
not communicating with each other.
% This is a weighted sum of $w_i's$
As before, $W = 0$ if and only if no juror presses any buttons between times $t_1$ and $t_2$,
indicating zero trust leant to $\phi$. In such a case, the system ignores $\phi$ in updating its beliefs.
And just as no individual juror can send a full-confidence update to the system,
	the system cannot recieve a full-confidence from the jurors as a whole.
	
The picture gets significantly more complicated if we consider the possibility
that jurors might press the $\mathsf N$ button. For example, if $\phi$, which was intended
as evidence of guilt, has the effect of getting jurors to press $\mathsf N$, there is a sense
in which they have \emph{negative} confidence in $\phi$, since the belief update happened in the opposite direction of what $\phi$ represents; rather than \emph{no} trust, this is represents \emph{distrust}. 
Small negative updates are always possible except at the boundary of belief space, but in this paper, we focus almost entirely on positive confidence updates.

The introduction of the second button also uncovers a significant source of complexity:
unlike \cref{ex:prob-simple,ex:classifier,ex:shafer}, 
the order that evidence is presented matters, when there is more than one possible response to it.
Evidence presented later has a larger effect,
meaning that this system exhibits a recency bias.
% (This lack of commutativity corresponds to possibility that,
%	as a Lie algebra, the bracket may not be identically zero.)

Now consider a variant of this system that does
not trust all jurors equally; rather, it trusts each juror $j$
to a degree $\beta_j \in [0, \infty]$, and now $g$ evolves
according to
\[
	\frac{\mathrm dg}{\mathrm dt} = 
	\sum_{j = 1}^J \beta_j \Big( G_j(t) (1-g) 
		- g N_j(t) \Big).
	% \begin{cases}
	% 	(1 - p)	& \text{button $\uparrow$ pressed} \\
	% 	-p & \text{button $\downarrow$ pressed}
	% \end{cases}	
\]
In this case, the system can be said to have trust $\beta_j$ in juror
$j$, since $j$'s buttons are ignored when $\beta_j = 0$. 
When $\beta_j = \infty$ (an expression of full confidence in $j$),
$g$ immediately jumps to 0 when $j$ presses 
$\mathsf N$, or to 1 if $j$ presses $\mathsf G$ (unless canceled by
another full-confidence juror pressing the opposite button).
If all jurors have full confidence, then the verdict of this system is
a majority vote at the last moment a button was pressed. 
Thus, the weights attached to weighted combinations are (additive) expressions 
of confidence as well. 
\end{example}

\cref{ex:jugo} illustrates how a (sufficiently nice) vector field, 
	which is simpler than a smooth path for every starting point, is enough to define
an additive notion of confidence, via its integral curves.
It may seem strange to define confidence via a vector field, which does not mention confidence at all---but in a sense, it works because a vector field captures precisely everything about the update \emph{except} for the confidence. We do this formally in \cref{sec:vecrep}. 

In \cref{sec:loss-repr}, we demonstrate that it is typically possible to get an even more compact representation of the updating process, by representing the vector field implicitly as gradients of some ``loss function''.
To do this at full generality, we need to make sense of a gradient, which requires more structure, in the form of a Riemannian metric.  It turns out that, up to a multiplicative constant, there is a unique natural Riemannian metric on any parameterization of a probability distributions \cite{chentsov}; taking gradients with respect to this geometry, show how familiar loss functions on probability measures correspond to different standard notions of confidence in the other representations.

Once we have the formalism, fully in place, we give further examples of how confidence works in exponential families, in particular showing how Kallman gain and inverse variance can be viewed as confidence as well.

\commentout{
This general idea can be cleaned up by appeal to differential geometry.
Fix an input $\phi$.
Assuming that the update paths are differentiable in the degree of confidence at any initial beleifs, the collection of updates with infinitessimal confidence forms a complete vector field $X_\phi$ over the space of beliefs, whose integral curves are paths in belief space, parameterized by confidence $\beta \in [0,\infty]$.
% Of course, we may always convert this number back to $[0,1]$,
We step through this more carefully in \cref{sec:field-repr}.

%joe1*: NO!  This is not the place to bring up Reimannian metrics!
Finally, if our belief space is endowed with a Riemannian metric, so that we may take gradients, partial update functions may be specified by a loss.}

	\subsection{Other Conceptions of Confidence.}

	\textbf{Probability.}
	% Probability is a numerical scale that ranges from untenable (0) to undeniable (1).
	% No number on this scale is truly neutral.
	% One of the biggest shortcomings of probability is its inability to represent a truly neutral attitude towards a proposition.
	Some people do use ``confidence'' to mean the same thing as probability. When they say they have low confidence in $\phi$, they mean that they think $\phi$ is unlikely.

	One of the biggest shortcomings of probability is its inability to represent a truly neutral attitude towards a proposition.
	%  probability of $\frac12$ .
	% This shortcoming has perhaps been the primary selling point of many alternatives to probabiltiy, such as Dempster-Shafer Belief functions.
	A value of $\frac12$ may be equally far from zero as it is from one, but is by no means a neutral assessment in all cases: hearing that your favored candidate has a 50\% chance of winning is big news if a win was previously thought to be inevitable.
	For this reason, telling someone the odds are 50/50 is quite different from saying you have no idea.
	% By contrast, zero confidence represents a truly neutral stance; a statement with zero confidence has no effect.
	By contrast, zero confidence represents something truly neutral:
		a statement made with zero confidence does not stake out a claim, and
		a statement recieved with zero confidence does not affect the recipient's beliefs.
	Nevertheless, in some contexts, we will see that confidences correspond to to probabilities.

	\textit{Opacity.} To use a graphical metaphor, think of certainty as black or white.
	Probability describes shades of gray, while confidence describes opacity.
	If we are painting with black and start with a white canvas, there is a precise correspondence between the opacity and the resulting shade of gray.

	\textbf{Upper and Lower Probabilities.}
	Upper and lower probabilities can describe a neutral attitude towards a proposition, but they are not really a specification of trust, but rather a direct specification of a belief state.
	It isn't immediately clear how to use these representations of uncertainty to update, and they're a little too complex to function effectively as the primitive measure of trust that we're after.


	\textbf{Shafer's Weight of Evidence.}
	Shafer's ``weight of evidence'' is precisely the same concept we have in mind.
	Our analysis precsely reduces to his, in the setting where belief states are Belief functions (which generalize probabilities, but not, say, neural network weights), and observations are events.
	% This paper can be a generalization of Shafer's ``weight of evidence'' to a broader class of settings, where one might have very different belief states and observations.
	Thus, this paper can be viewed as generalizing this concept to a broader class of settings, without requiring that one adopt Shafer's conception of a belief state or an observation.


	\textbf{Variance and Entropy.}
	The inverse of variance, sometimes known as precision,
		is also commonly used to measure confidence.
	If a sensor is unreliable and can give a range of answers, the variance of the estimate is a very common way of quantifying this reliablility.
	If measurements have zero variance, in some sense one has absolute confidence ($\top$) in the sensor. If measurements have infinite variance, then in some sense one has no confidence in the sensor, since individual samples convey no information about the true value of the quantity measured.
	As with probability, inverse variance will coincide with confidence in some settings; we will see how in \cref{sec:variance}.

	Entropy, like variance, is a standard way of measuring uncertainty, and in some settings, confidence coincides with entropy (see \cref{sec:entropy}).
	The assumption underlying both approaches is that there's some ``true'' value of the variable, and that the randomness is epsistemic (due to sensor errors) rather than aleotoric (inherrent in the quantity being measured).

	\textbf{Confidence Intervals and Error Bars.}
	Another notion of the word ``confidence'' comes from the term ``confidence interval''.
	This concept arises in settings involving a probability distribution $\Pr(X)$ over a metric space $X$, typically $X = \mathbb R$.
	A 95\% confidence interval is the (largest) ball containing 95\% of the probability, and its size is a geometric measurement of how .
	This intuition behind this reading of the word confidence is the same as
