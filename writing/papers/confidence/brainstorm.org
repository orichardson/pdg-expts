* AN UPDATE RULE
* Trust in One Another
Beta between elements?
What we've been calling \beta is the trust the modeler (\mu) has in each of the cpds.

** Information Flow via Trust
A uses the information from B if A trusts B.

Not using the information:
  A.in, others -> A.out;

Using the information: A.in += B.out.

* THERMODYNAMICS
Beta as a generalized force.


* Observation
Looking Backwards, you want to be accurate
Looking Forwards, it's sometimes useful to be...

 - wishful (you have a guardian angel or only care about high utility events)
 - fearful (you have a curse or mostly care about highly unpleasant events)




* POTENTIAL TASKS

** Hamilton's Equations
Differentiate Potential with respect to coordinates, and with respect to \beta (momenta/forces?).

See if Hamilton's Equations hold
