\section{General Thoughts}
Confidence is an important aspect of knowledge representation.

% The notion of confidence also has 
% Confidence is the opposite of uncertainty: you cannot be uncertain about $X$ .
Confidence is often thought of as the opposite of uncertainty.

Can you can be confident that $X$ is uncertain?
There is a huge difference between 


% Here we draw a distinction between confidence and certainty:
% while you are certain that [proposition], 

Confidence is intimately related to probability, and our development will largely be couched in (higher-order) probabilistic terms.
Nevertheless, we submit that in many cases---and especially in more subjective or computationally restricted settings---probability alone is not enough, and the higher-order probabilistic picture is far too extreme.


% We want to be able to entertain and reason about models we aren't sure about.

\subsection*{Our Approach}
% Here is the idea: if you are confident in $X$, then you are 
The idea is to view confidence as a property of an update, not as a property of a point of view. 
This allows us to distinguish between ...

\begin{example}
Let $X$ be a binary random variable, and suppose you have a prior probability $p$ that $X=1$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $p=1$. 
    This is a poor choice of prior. 
    If you then recieve information that $X=0$, something has gone very wrong, and the Bayesian update is undefined.
    
    If you rceive information that $X = 1$, your internal state should not change. 
    % If we characterize  
    
    \item One might argue that only positive probabilities are relevant.
    Suppose $p = 1 - \epsilon$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}


\subsection*{Issues To Address}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The difference between having confidence in \emph{a source} and confidence in a particular \emph{fact}.  Is one more general than the other? 

\end{enmerate}
    
Some intuitive features we might want to capture:
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Trust Dynamics.} If a trusted source tells you something you already believe, your confidence in them goes up (maybe). Certainly if a source tells you something you know to be wrong, your confidence in the source goes down.  Whether or not you adopt the 
    
    Also, if you ultimately end up adopting the belief, and later end up with a more coherent picture of the world, your trust in the source should go way up --- it's reasonable to place the most trust in sources that tell you true things that conflict with your current beliefs.

\section{Update Rules}
\def\X{\mathcal X}
Let $\X = (X, \mathcal A)$ be a measurable space, so that $X$ is a set and $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra over $X$, and let $\Delta \X$ denote the set of probability measures over $\X$.

We are interested in updating rules
\[ 
    F: (\text{Confidence} : \mathbb R) \times (\text{Event} : \mathcal A) \to (\Delta\X  \to \Delta \X) 
\]
which describe how to update beliefs about $X$, when you a 

If $F$ is an update rule, we write $F^\beta_A : \Delta\X \to \Delta X$ for
  

satisfying the following axioms:

For all $A \in \mathcal A$, and all $\beta,\beta_1, \beta_2 \in \mathbb R$
\begin{enumerate}[label=U\arabic{*}.]
    % \item \textbf{(zero)} $F^{0}_A(\Pr) = (\Pr)$
    \item \textbf{(zero)~} $F^{0}_A  =  \mathrm{Id}_{\Delta\X}$. (That is, $F^{0}_A(\Pr) = (\Pr)$ for all $\Pr \in \Delta\X$.)
    \item \textbf{(additivity)~} $F^{\beta_1}_A \circ F^{\beta_2}_A = F^{\beta_1 + \beta_2}_A$
    
    \item \textbf{(absolute certainty)~} $\displaystyle \lim_{\beta\to\infty} F^\beta_A (\Pr) = \Pr|A$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[resume,label=U\arabic{*}.]
    \item \textbf{(decomposition)~} If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $F^{\beta}_A \circ F^{\beta}_B = F^{\beta}_{A \cap B}$.
\end{enumerate}

We can also consider the variant
\begin{enumerate}
    % \item[U3$'$.]  \textbf{(effectiveness)~} $\supp F^\infty_A (\Pr) \subset A $
    \item[U3$'$.]  \textbf{(effectiveness)~} $F^\infty_A (\Pr)(A) = 1$

\end{enumerate}

\section{Higher Order Probability Measures}
Consider the following ways of extracting an (ordinary) probability measure $\mu(\Omega)$
from a higher order probability $\Pr(\mu(\Omega))$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Centroid.}  
        % $\mu^* := \textit{centroid}(\Pr)$.\\
        Given by 
        \[
            \mu^*(A) := \Ex_{\mu \sim \Pr} \mu(A) = 
                \iint \Pr(\mu) \mu(x) 1_{A}(x)\, \mathrm d x\,\mathrm d\mu,
        \]
        the centroid is the usual ``flattening'' of a higher-order probability distribution, and corresponds to 
        of the Giry Monad.
        
    \item \textbf{Highest Likelihood.}    
        $\textit{MLE}(\Pr) := A \mapsto (\arg\max_\mu \Pr(\mu))(A)$
        
        This is the way that people often do inference.
        
    \item \textbf{MAP Inference.}
        Suppose we have a prior $\Pr_0$ over  $\Pr$

\end{enumerate}
