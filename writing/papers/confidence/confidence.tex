While high confidence in an event is much like high probability in the event, low confidence in the event and low probability are entriely different. 


\section{The Translucency Analogy}

% \begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}

    So far as graphics are concerned, what ultimately matters are pixel colors. 
    And yet, in the standard representation of pixel color, only three of the four bytes actually represent a color; the last byte gives a measure of translucency.
    This is no accident---being able to suggest a color in a location with less than complete confidence is incredibly useful. 
    It enables much more intricate digital art, via layers. 
    It makes it possible to model visual effects such as fog and fireworks without needing to simultaneously know everything that happens behinds them.
    % This is not an oversight; working with translucency can be incredibly valuable.

\section{Update Rules}
\def\X{\mathcal X}
Let $\X = (X, \mathcal A)$ be a measurable space, so that $X$ is a set and $\mathcal A$ be a $\sigma$-algebra over $X$, and let $\Delta \X$ denote the set of probability measures over $\X$.
% maybe??
Let $\Phi$ be the set of statements about $X$ --- that is, the things one can have confidence in. 
A \emph{update rule} for $\Phi$ on $\X$ is a function of the form
\[
    F: (\text{confidence}\,\beta : \mathbb R) \times (\text{statement}\,\phi : \Phi) \to (\Delta\X  \to \Delta \X),
\]
which describe how to update beliefs about $X$, with the new information, at a certain level of trust.
Given a piece of information $\phi \in \Phi$, and confidence $\beta$, we write $F^\beta_\phi : \Delta\X \to \Delta X$ for action of the update rule on beliefs. 
Note that updates can be composed. For instance, starting with a distribution $\mu_0 \in \Delta \X$, we can \emph{compose} updates, such as in:
\[
    \mu_0 
        \xmapsto{F^1_{\phi}} \mu' 
        \xmapsto{F^{0.3}_{\phi'}} \mu''
        \xmapsto{F^{7}_{\phi}} \mu'''.
\]

% We would like update rules to satisfy the following axioms:
Here are some reasonable properties one might expect an udpate rule to have. 
For all $A \in \mathcal A$, and all $\beta,\beta_1, \beta_2 \in \mathbb R$:

\subsection{Compatibility With Further Structure}
% \textit{DIVERGENCE.~~}
% \textbf{Divergence.}
\subsubsection*{Potentials: Divergences and Cost Functions}
Suppose that, in addition, we have a ``divergence'' function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb R^+$ on $X$, with the property that $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x = y$.
For sets $A \subset X$, let $d(x, A) := \inf_{a \in A} d(x,a)$ be the smallest possible divergence between $x$ and any member of $A$; symmetrically, define $d(A, x) := \inf_{a \in A} d(a,x)$.

% What we are trying to do with divergence functions here is an example of a
% slightly more broader definition,
If we drop the requirement that the smallest possible value of $d(A,x)$ must equal zero, we obtain the more general notion of a cost (or loss) function, $c :\mathcal A \times X \to \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ satisfying
\[
% c : \mathcal A \times X \to \mathbb R_{\ge 0}
% \quad\text{such that}\quad
\forall A \in \mathcal A.~\arg\min_{x} c_A(x) = A.
% \forall A \in \mathcal A.\quad c_A(x) = 0 ~\Leftrightarrow~ x \in A.%
% \footnote{Any $c$ with the property that $\arg\min_{x} c_A(x) = A$ for all $A$ only differs from such a $c$ by a constant.}
% \qquad \text{and}\qquad
% \inf_{a \in A} c_A()
\]
The idea is that, if $c(x)$ is some cost that ``incentivises'' membership in $A$, then increasing confidence in $A$ ought decrease expected cost. 
% Note that given a divergence function $d$ as described above, the expression $d(A, x) = \inf_{a \in A} d(a,x)$ satisfies this criterion.
\begin{URaxioms}
    \item $\Ex_{F^{\beta}_A(\Pr)} [ c_A ]
        \le
        \Ex_{\Pr}[ c_A ]
    $
        \hfill \textbf{($c$\,-monotonicity)}
\end{URaxioms}


We can also use $c$ to define a notion of independence.

\begin{defn}[$c$-independence]
For $A,B,Z \subset X$,
we say that $A$ and $B$ are $c$-independent given $Z$ iff
% $d(A, b) = d(a, B)$ for all $a\in A$ and $b \in B$.
for all $z \in Z$, we have that
% $c(z, A \cap B) = c(z, A) + c(z,B)$.
$c_{A\cap B}(z) = c_{A}(z) + c_{B}(z)$.
\end{defn}

To give a few examples:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every set $A \in\mathcal A$ is independent of the trivial event $X$, since
        $
            c(z, A\cap X) = c(z, A)
        $
        and $c(z, X) = 0$.
    \item Suppose $\X$ is a subset of $\mathbb R^n$, so that $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and cost is L1 distance, given by $c(x,A) = \inf_{a \in A} \sum_{i=1}^n {|a_i - x_i|}$. Now for $i\ne j$,
    the sets $A_i(b) := \{ x : x_i = b \}$
    and $A_j(b') := \{x : x_j = b' \}$ are unconditionally $c$-independent.
    This makes sense, since they are orthogonal hyperplanes.

    \item  Suppose $\X \cong Y \times Z$ is a product space, to be thought of as the set of possible joint settings of two variables $Y$ and $Z$.
    Now, fix a probability measure $p(Y,Z)$ over $\X$
    and let
    % $c(x, A) := \I_{p|A}(\{x\}) = -\log P(x | A)$.
    $c(x, A) := -\log p(A \cap \{x\})$, with the convention that $-\log 0 = \infty$.
    Then, $A, B$ are $c$-independent given $Z$ iff
    \[
        - \log p(A \cap B \cap \{z\}) =
        - \log p(A \cap \{z\}) - \log p(B \cap \{z\})
    \]
    If $z \notin A \cap B$, then both sides will be infinite. If $z \in A \cap B$,
    \[
        - \log p(z) = - \log p(z) - \log p(z)
        \quad\iff\quad
        p(z) = p(z)^2
        \quad\iff\quad
        p(z) \in \{0,1\}
    \]
\end{enumerate}

Once we have a notion of independence such as this one (although we will also consider others), we can articulate another axiom for update rules:
\begin{URaxioms}
% \begin{enumerate}[resume,label=\textbf{UR\arabic{*}.},nosep,leftmargin=2cm]
    % \item[\textbf{UR4}.]
    \item
    % \item[\textbf{UR4-d}.]
    % If $A$ and $B$ are $d$-independent, then
    % $F^{\beta}_A \circ F^{\beta}_B = F^{\beta}_{A \cap B}$.
    %     \hfill \textbf{($d$-decomposition)}
    If $A$ and $B$ are independent given $\supp(\Pr)$, then \\
    $F^{\beta}_A \circ F^{\beta}_B (\Pr) = F^{\beta}_{A \cap B}(\Pr)$.
        \hfill \textbf{(decomposition)}
    % \item $\Ex_{F^\beta_A \Pr}[ d(X,A)]$ is (strictly) decreasing in $\beta$, so long as it is positive
    % \hfill \textbf{(monotonicity)}
% \end{enumerate}
\end{URaxioms}
The intuition here is

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[\textbf{UR4-c}.] If $A$ and $B$ are $d$-independent, then $F^{\beta}_A \circ F^{\beta}_B = F^{\beta}_{A \cap B}$.

\section{Vector Field Representations of Update Rules}
For a smooth manifold $M$, and a point $p \in M$, let $T_p M$ be the tangent space to $M$ at point $p$ (\cite{leesmoothmanifolds}), and let
% $TM := \sqcup_{p \in M} (p, T_p M)$
$TM := \sum_{p \in M} T_p M$
be the tangent bundle over $M$.
A vector field over $M$ is a smooth map $\mat v : M \to T M$ assigning a tangent vector $\mat v(p) \in T_p M$, to every point $p \in M$. 

\begin{theorem}
    There is a bijection between
    update rules $F : \Phi \times \mathbb R \to \Delta \X \to \Delta \X$
        satisfying \cref{ax:zero,ax:additivity,ax:diffble}, 
    and $\Phi$-indexed collections of vector fields 
        $\{ F'_\phi : \Delta X \to T \Delta X \}_{\phi \in \Phi}$%
        % $F' : \Phi \to \Delta\X \to T\Delta \X$%
    .
\end{theorem}

One nice feature of a vector fields is that they are closed under linear combination.  

% \subsection{The Cannoncial Update Rules}
\subsection{Canoncial Update Rules}
% To give a non-subjective interpretation of the update rules that follow,
Imagine that $\X$ is a space of possible phenotypes, and that a probability $\Pr \in \Delta\!\X$ represents a population distribution.

\subsubsection{Decay}
Given a measurable space $\mathcal X = (X, \mathcal A)$ and measurable lost function\\
$\ell: \X\times\mathcal A \to \mathbb R^+$, the
canonical decay update rule, or \emph{$\ell$-selector} is given by
% \def\cost#1#2{c(#1,#2)}
% \def\cost#1#2{d(#1,#2)}
\def\cost#1#2{\ell_{#2}(#1)}
\begin{align*}
    F^\beta_A(\Pr)(x) &\propto \Pr(x) \cdot \exp(-\beta \cost xA) \\
    F^\beta_A(\Pr)(B) &:=  \frac{1}{\Ex_{\Pr}[\exp(-\beta \cost xA )]}
        \int 1_B(x) \; \exp(-\beta \cost xA ) \,\mathrm d\Pr(x)
    %
\end{align*}

The name comes from the fact that, in our analogy to a population, an update of this kind corresponds to \emph{selection}.
% More concretely, applying $F^\beta_\ell$ to a population distributed according to $P$, is equivalent to the following algorithm:


% \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
%     \item Input: population distribution, a multiset $P$ of values of $x$, distributed according to $p(X)$.
%     \item Select a member $x$ of the population $P$.
%     \item
%         % Replace $x$ with $e^{-\ell(x)}$ copies of $x$.
%         Allow the population of $x$'s to grow/decay with rate $\ell(x)$, over a period $\beta$ of time.
%     \item Repeat.
% \end{enumerate}


\begin{prop}
    The cannonical update rule satisfies UR1-6.
\end{prop}




\begin{conj}
    %[Characterization Theorem]
    % Any update rule $F$ satisfying UR1-6 is a decay update rule for some cost function $c : \mathcal A \times X \to \mathbb R$.
    Any update rule satisfying UR1-6 (++more) is a decay update rule for some cost function.
\end{conj}


\subsubsection{Flow}
\def\vgrad{\boldsymbol\nabla}
% \def\vgrad{\vec\nabla}
The update rule above only ``moves'' distributions by decay. If we imagine a distribution representing a population of individuals, the distribution has shifted by selection: an application of the update rule $F_A^\beta$ corresponds to culling the population, in proportion to their distance from $A$, over a time period of length $\beta$.
It is worth noting that such a population is then smaller, and must be re-normalized later.

A distribution could also shift by genuine motion of the underlying individuals.
In this case, let's model this as a partial differential equation in terms of $\Pr(x,t)$.
Now, we have some kind of conservation of mass, so from the continuity equation, we get
$\frac{\partial }{\partial t}Pr(x,t) = - \vgrad \cdot \mat J$,
where $\mat J(x,t)$ is the flux of individuals at point $x$ and time $t$.
Further assuming that the flux is generated by a combination of diffusion and a potential proportional to distance to $A$, we obtain

\[
    \frac{\partial \Pr(x, t)}{\partial t} = \vgrad_{\!x} \cdot \Big( k \vgrad_{\!x} \Pr (x) - \beta \vgrad_{\!x} d(x, A) \Big)
\]
where $k$ is a diffusion coefficient, and $\beta$

% To draw a different analogy, we can think of


\subsubsection{Drift}
We have talked about selection, but what about the second major force that drives evolution: random mutations?
% The important feature here is that not all information is truly used to find
% The result is that the population tends to ``spread out'', all else being equal,
% and has the effect of mixing the
One effect is that if there's no selection pressure to favor one variant over another, over time both variants will be represented equally.
Suppose that the elements of $\X$ have a canonical coded representation (such as DNA), such that specifying different phenotypes $x \in X$ requires different code lengths.
Because there is a tangible cost to carrying a larger genome, this induces a base measure with an inductive bias towards shorter codes.
% So the effect of random mutations is to mix

% \subsubsection{Sex}
% Sex is the thing that separates ``genetic algorithms'' from vanilla gradient descent.
%
% \begin{align*}
%     F^\beta_A(\Pr)(x) &\propto \Pr(x) \cdot \exp(-\beta \cost xA) \\
% \end{align*}

\section{Examples}

\subsection{The Two-Point Space}
First, suppose $X = \{0,1\}$ and $\mathcal A = 2^X$.

\begin{claim}
The space of update rules satisfying
% UR1-6
\cref{ax:zero,ax:additivity,ax:certainty,ax:symmetry,ax:diffble}
% is in bijection with continuous monotone functions
is in bijection with the space of strictly increasing functions
$\gamma : [0,\infty) \to [0,1]$
% in the space $\Delta X \cong [0,1]$ of probability distributions over $\{0,1\}$,
such that
% \begin{align*}
%     \gamma_0(0) &= 1
%     &
%         \gamma_1(0) &= 0
%         \\
%     \lim_{t\to\infty}\gamma_0(t) &= 0
%     &
%         \lim_{t\to\infty}\gamma_1(t) &= 1
%         \\
% \end{align*}
$\gamma(0) = 0$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}\gamma(t) = 1$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Let's first investigate the behavior of an update rule $F$ on the singleton $A := \{1\}$.
    % Fix some $\epsilon > 0$.
    % By \Cref{ax:zero,ax:additivity}
    % \ref{ax:effectiveness}
    % \cref{ax:effectiveness}
    By \ref{ax:effectiveness} or \cref{ax:certainty} we know that, for any $p \in \Delta\{0,1\}$, and particularly for $p$ equal to the degenerate distribution $\delta_0$ that places all mass on the outcome $X=0$, we have
    \[
        \lim_{\beta \to \infty} F^\beta_{\{1\}}(\delta_0) = \delta_1.
    \]
    By \cref{ax:zero}, we also have $F^0_{\{1\}}(\delta_0) = \delta_1$. Note that $\Delta\{0,1\}$ is isomorphic to $[0,1]$, with $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$ as the endpoints.  So, from continuity of $F$ in $\beta$ (\cref{ax:diffble}) and the intermediate value theorem, for all distributions $p \in \Delta\{0,1\}$, there is some $\hat\beta_p$ such that $F^{\hat\beta_p}_{\{1\}}(\delta_0) = p$.
    Furthermore, the resulting probability must be strictly increasing, because if

    Thus, the function $\gamma(t) := F^{t}_{\{1\}}(\delta_0)(X=1)$ is a continuous monotone function from $[0,\infty)$ to $[0,1]$ with $\gamma(0) = 0$,
    % (as $F^0_{\{1\}}(\delta_0)(X=1) = \delta_0(X=1) = 0$)
    and $\lim_{t\to\infty} \gamma(t) = \delta_1$.


    Conversely, given such a function, we can define an update rule for the singleton $A = \{1\}$, as
    \[
        F^{\beta}_{\{1\}}(p) :=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \mapsto& \gamma(\beta - \beta_p) \\
            0 \mapsto& 1-\gamma(\beta - \beta_p)
        \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    % \[
    %     F^{\beta}_{\{1\}}
    %
\end{proof}

The selectors are of the form
\begin{align*}
    F_0^\beta(p) &:= \sigma( \sigma^{-1}(p) - \beta a)
\end{align*}
where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is the logistic function,

\subsection{Finite Spaces}
Now, for some $n \in \mathbb N$, suppose $X := [n] = \{1, \ldots, n\}$, and $\mathcal A$ be all subsets of $X$.

\subsection{Gaussians}
Consider the case where $\X$ is the set of real numbers with the Borell $\sigma$-algebra, and $d(x,y) := (x-y)^2$.
Then the cannoncial update rule corresponds to multiplying by a Gaussian density, whose variance is $\nicefrac1\beta$.

Furthermore, applying it to a distribution which is already Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, we find that
\begin{align*}
    F^{\beta}_{X=b}(\mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2))(x) &\propto
        \exp\left\{ - \frac12 \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{ \sigma^2 } - \beta(x-b)^2\right\}
    \\&\propto \mathcal N(x| \mu', \sigma'^2)
\end{align*}
which is itself a Gaussian with mean equal to the weighted average of $\mu$ and $\beta$.

The upshot is that


\subsection{Higher Order Probability Measures}
Now, suppose $\X$ is itself a set or probability measures.

\[
\]



Consider the following ways of extracting an (ordinary) probability measure $\mu(\Omega)$
from a higher order probability $\Pr(\mu(\Omega))$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Centroid (Mean).}
        % $\mu^* := \textit{centroid}(\Pr)$.\\
        On a measurable set $A \in \mathcal A$, the centroid of $\Pr$ is defined as
        \[
            \mu^{\text{avg}}(A) := \Ex_{\mu \sim \Pr}[ \mu(A)] =
                \iint \Pr(\mu) \mu(x) 1_{A}(x)\, \mathrm d x\,\mathrm d\mu,
        \]
        the centroid is the usual ``flattening'' of a higher-order probability distribution, and corresponds to
        of the Giry Monad.

    \item \textbf{Highest Likelihood (Mode).}
        $\textit{MLE}(\Pr) := A \mapsto (\arg\max_\mu \Pr(\mu))(A)$

        This is the way that people often do inference.

    \item \textbf{MAP Inference.}
        Suppose we have a prior $\Pr_0$ over  $\Pr$

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{PDGs}

Given a PDG $\dg M$, let $\X := \Delta\V(\dg M) = \Delta(\prod_{X\in\N}\V(X))$. For each edge we have
\[
    F_L^{\beta}(\Pr) (\mu) \propto \Pr(\mu) \exp(-\beta \kldiv\mu \bp)
\]
This extends to
\[
    F_{\dg M}^k(\Pr)(\mu) \propto \Pr(\mu) \exp(- k \bbr{\dg M}_0(\mu))
\]
Note that
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{k \to \infty} F_{\dg M}^k(\Pr)(\mu) &\propto
        % \mathbbm1[\mu \in {\displaystyle\SD{\dg M}}]
        \Pr(\mu) \mathbbm1[\mu \in {\bbr{\dg M}^*_0}] \\
        &= \Pr \,|\, \bbr{\dg M}^*_0 \\
        &= \Pr \,|\, \SD{\dg M} \text{~if $\dg M$ is consistent.}
        % &= \mathrm{Unif}_{\{\!\!\{{\dg M}\}\!\!\}} \text{~if $\dg M$ is consistent.}
\end{align*}

On the other hand,
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{k \to 0} F_{\dg M}^k(\Pr)(\mu) &= \Pr \,|\, \Inc(\mu) < \infty \\
        &= \Pr \,|\, \{\mu : \forall L.~\mu(Y|X) \ll \bp \}.
        % \quad\Big(\text{i.e., if $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\bp$}
        % \Big)
\end{align*}
That is to say, in the limit of small $\gamma$, applying the update rule is like
On the other hand, $F_{\dg M}^0(\Pr) = \Pr$. So $F$ can only be continuous at $k=0$ for $\Pr$ if, for all edges $L \in \Ed$, we have that $\Pr(\mu(Y|X) \ll \bp) = 1$.




\subsection{The Qualitative Half}


There are a number of different ways to think about alpha.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item $\alpha_L$ is your confidence in the functional dependence of $Y$ on $X$, given
    \item $\alpha_L$ is the ``alignment'' of the edge $L$
\end{enumerate}

We need a different distance function for the other half. Now we use
$d(\mu, DET)$.

% \begin{align*}
%
% \end{align*}

We need a different distance function for the qualitative loss function of a PDG.
Why measure distance differently in this case?

\section{General Thoughts}
(Variable) confidence is an important aspect of knowledge representation, because we need be able to entertain possibilities and reason about models we aren't sure about.

% The notion of confidence also has
% Confidence is the opposite of uncertainty: you cannot be uncertain about $X$ .
Confidence is often thought of as the opposite of uncertainty.


% Confidence is dual to information.
One has confidence in information.
Confidence and Information are thermodynamically ``conjugate variables''.


``cool-headed'' means calculated (a vote of confidence) while ``hot-headed'' means rash (such an assessment indicates a lack of confidence). Confidence is like inverse temperature.

Can you can be confident that $X$ is uncertain?
There is a huge difference between being certain that a coin has is fair, and knowing nothing about it.


% Here we draw a distinction between confidence and certainty:
% while you are certain that [proposition],

Confidence is intimately related to probability, and our development will largely be couched in probabilistic terms. But they are not the same concept. 
While having high confidence in $\varphi$ is not so different from thinking $\varphi$ likely, having \emph{low confidence} in $\varphi$ is not the same as having thinking $\varphi$ is unlikely.
To illustrate, consider a statement made by friend (a high-confidence source) and an adversary (a low-confidence source). 
 

% Nevertheless, we submit that in many cases---and especially in more subjective or computationally restricted settings---probability alone is not enough, and the higher-order probabilistic picture is far too extreme.

Confidence as learning rate. Bigger confidence ~= bigger step size.
Learning algorithms have learning rate schedules (rates decrease or cycle).  

\subsection*{Our Approach}
% Here is the idea: if you are confident in $X$, then you are
The idea is to view confidence as a property of an update, not as a property of a point of view.
In this telling

This allows us to distinguish between ...
%

% \begin{example}
% Let $X$ be a binary random variable, and suppose you have a prior probability $p$ that $X=1$.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Suppose $p=1$.
%     This is a poor choice of prior.
%     If you then recieve information that $X=0$, something has gone very wrong, and the Bayesian update is undefined.
%
%     If you rceive information that $X = 1$, your internal state should not change.
%     % If we characterize
%
%     \item One might argue that only positive probabilities are relevant.
%     Suppose $p = 1 - \epsilon$.
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{example}


\subsection*{Issues To Address}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The difference between having confidence in \emph{a source} and confidence in a particular \emph{fact}.  Is one more general than the other?
\end{enumerate}

Some intuitive features we might want to capture:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Trust Dynamics.} If a trusted source tells you something you already believe, your confidence in them goes up (maybe). Certainly if a source tells you something you know to be wrong, your confidence in the source goes down.  Whether or not you adopt the

    Also, if you ultimately end up adopting the belief, and later end upwith a more coherent picture of the world, your trust in the source should go way up.
    This is because in the end we want to place the most trust in sources that tell you the truth, not what you expect (or want) to hear.

    A source that tells you only exactly what you already believe ``artificially'' increases your confidence but does not actually provide you any information, unless they came to hold the same views independently.
