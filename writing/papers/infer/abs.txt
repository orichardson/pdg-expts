--- abstract
Probabilistic dependency graphs (PDGs) are a flexible class of probabilistic graphical models, subsuming Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs. They can also capture inconsistent beliefs, and provide a way of measuring the degree of this inconsistency. We provide the first tractable inference algorithm for PDGs, making the complexity of inference for PDGs asymptotically comparable to that of the graphical models they generalize. The key components of our approach are (1) the observation that PDG inference can be reduced to convex optimization with exponential cone constraints, (2) a construction that allows us to express these problems compactly for PDGs of boundeed treewidth, for which we needed to further develop the theory of PDGs, and (3) an appeal to interior point methods that can solve such problems in polynomial time. We verify the correctness and complexity of our approach, provide an implementation, and a preliminary analysis.
