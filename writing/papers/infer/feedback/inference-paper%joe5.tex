\section{INTRODUCTION}


% {\color{gray}
% Suppose that we have a collection of probabilistic beliefs.
% How can we tell if they are self-consistent?
% How difficult is it to measure how inconsistent they are?
% How much computation is necessary to synthesize our beliefs into a single joint probability distribution?
% This paper provides answers---both
% theoretical and practical---to these questions. }
%joe3*: While these are interesting questions, they are not the
%standard questions tyhat have been asked when it comes to inference.
%since no other approach can capture inconsistency well, no one has
%asked the question of how inconsistent beliefs are (to the best of my
%knowledge). Moreover, the notion of inconsistency you're dealing
%with is an idiosyncratic notion, that you tailored to PDGs.   That
%means the leadoff paragraph does not situate this work well in the
%ocntext of what's been done.  It may be better to start with
%inference (what you denote as (Q)) and then move to inconsistency,
%rather than the other way around, as you've done.  I think that would
%make the story read better.

and Factor Graphs (FGs).
%joe1: much too wordy
%The primary force behind the expressiveness of pdgs is their ability
%to capture inconsistent beliefs, and the natural way of measuring the
%degree of this inconsistency that the formalism provides.
%joe4
%Unlike the models they generalize,
% PDGs can capture inconsistent beliefs, and have an associated measure
%joe4: a PDG doesn't "have probabilities", and I don't know what it
%means for a PDG to be being self-consistent.
%oli4: I don't get this comment. Obviously it has probabilities. A PDG is a collection of (conditional) probabilites (that aren't all over the same variable, or conditioned on the same events). That is, the most general container for probabilistic information.
%oli4: your rewrite (below) isn't talking about the same thign I am. What you're talking about is what we call ``incompatibility'', not inconsistency. The inconsistency is the more important notion.
%| of inconsistency that quantifies how far a probability measure is from
%| satisfying the constraints of the PDG.
%oli4: ^ I also don't like calling the conditional probabilities "constraints", for a couple of reasons: (1) as a modeling tool, I want people to just articulate all of the probailistic beliefs they have on hand, and the term "constraint" suggests particular flavor or strength of belief; (2) we expect that typicallly all of the constraints will be violated.
%oli4: How is this for a compromise, that doesn't include "self-consistency"?
%joe5: A PDG doesn't "contain" belief
%joe5: I don't find it so natural.  Moreover, we're not measuring the
%degree of inconsistency of a PDG; we're measuring how inconsistent a
%PDG is with a particular proability distribution
%A PDG can contain inconsistent beliefs, and there is a natural way
%measuring its degree of inconsistency. 
They can also capture inconsistent beliefs; moreover, we can measure how
inconsistent a probability distribution is with a PDG.  This allows us
to define the dgree of inconsistent of a PDG to essentially be that of the
probability measure that is least inconsistent with it.
%joe4:this is clunky
%But, also unlike the models they generalize,
%PDGs have not had an inference algorithm%
%---%
%there has been no practical way to use a PDG answer questions of the form
Up to now,
there has been no practical way to do probabilistic inference using
PDGs, that is, to answer questions of the form
    ``what is the probability of $Y$ given $X$?''.
This paper presents the first such algorithm.
% o l i 4: de-emphasizing the algorithm.
% This paper presents the first one.

% Even the question of what an
%% So what is an inference algorithm for a PDG?
% Whereas Bayesian Networks and factor graphs clearly represent a single probability distribution, PDGs may repreent many.
% For general parameter settings, a PDG may not indicate just one distribution.
%joe5*: The issue isn't correctness but how we define inferfence.  I
%rewrote this pareagraph completely.  We need to tell the "right"
%story, and tell it early.  
Before discussing our algorithm, we must discuss what it even means to
do inference for a PDG.  
BNs and factor graphs represent a unique distribution.  Thus, for
example, when we
ask ``What is the probability of $Y$ given $X$'' in a Bayesian network
$B$, we mean ``what is $mu(Y \mid X)$?'' for the probability $\mu$
represented by $B$.  But a PDG does not, in general, represent a
unique probability distribution.
%joe5: adding material from my email

Like BNs, PDGs encode two types of information: ``structural''
information about the independence of causal mechanism, captured by
the structure of the graph, and ``observational'' information,
captured by the conditional probability distributions associated with
each edge in the graph.   Corresponding to these two types of
information, we have two loss functions, which associate with a
probability distribution $\mu$ how far $\mu$ is from capturing each of
these two types of information.
%joe5*: I would really prefer to have \gamm \in [0,1]; is it too late
%for that
Given a weight $\gamma \in
[0,\infty)$, we take the \emph{$\gamma$-semantics} of a PDG to be the
  set of distributions that minimize the observational loss function
  plus $\gamma$ times the structural loss function plus.  We can also
  consider the \emph{$*$-semantics}, which, roughly speaking, is the limit of $
  \gamma$-semantics as $\gamma$ goes to 0 (so amounts to focusing on
  the observational loss, using the structural loss only to break
  ties).  This gives us a family of inference notions, parameterized
  by $\gamma$ (or $*$), depending on how we choose to weight the loss
  function.  It can be shown that, given a PDG $M$,  if there are distributions
  consistent with both observational and the structural information in
  $M$, then all these inference notions coincide; that is, there is a
  single distribution $\mu_M$ that minimizes both loss functions, so
  no matter how we weight the loss functions, we want to answer
  queries with respect  to $\mu_M$.  Moreover, if $M$ represents a BN,
  then $\mu_M$ is the distribution represented by the BN.  
  However, if there is no
  distribution that is consistent with both types of information, then
  the choice of $\gamma$ matters.  Thus, we talk about
  $\gamma$-inference or $*$-inference.

%What does it mean to answer probabilistic queries \emph{correctly} for a PDG?
%The situation is more subtle that it is for other graphical models,
%because a PDG may 
%not just represent one probability distribution.
% It is true that PDGs
% As \authorcite{pdg-aaai} point out,
%joe4*: I'm afraid I don't liker "observatiosl surrogate: either.
%There's hothing that relates it to obervation (at least, not in the
%intro).  Why not just call it the "representative distribution", if
%you must give it a anme, or perhaps "the observational semantics (of
%PDG M)".
%oli4*: let's workshop this. I think it needs a name, in part because it's not the *only* representative distribution. I recall you suggesting "observational semantics", which was my starting point, but I think we can do better. What about "observational representative?" Some thoughts:
% (1) "Semantics" is usually contrasted with "syntax", which sometimes helpful, but often everything in sight will be semantics.
% (2) It might be helpful if the head noun could somehow emphasize that it is a joint distribution over all variables, or better yet, convey that this is the distribution that best incorporates all probabilistic observations.
% (3) "Semantics" is an even more technical word than "limit", and I think buys us less--- it's helpful to keep in mind that it's one end of a spectrum.
% In any case, I think we agree that the more important aspect of the the name needs to have something that specifies that it deals with \beta and Inc rather than \alpha and IDef.  "Observational-structural" seem to be our working consensus for the dichotomy. Is it really necessary to relate the term to the notion of observation in the intro? That seems difficult. In my opinion, we already do a reasonable job explaining where "observational" comes from once we dive into PDGs and define it properly.
%oli4: explaining the intuition further
% Nevertheless, under very mild assumptions 
% If one takes an extreme emperical view, 
%joe5: I don't know what makes this "empirical"; I think it's a
%mistake to focus on this, becuase we don't have good motivation for it.
%From an extreme emperical viewpoint,
%a PDG does single out a particular distribution which we call its
%``\obslimit''. 
%oli4: changing away from "primary"
% Our primary goal
%joe5: I now disagree
%One of our main goals 
%is to answer probabilistic queries with respect to this distribution.
%
%joe4*: isn't it actually a limit, rather than an "endpoint".  I don't
% know what "endpoint" means.
%joe5: your usage of the word endpoint here (like many of your other
%usages) is idiosyncractic.  The fact that you intend to complete an
%open interval with its endpoint is not something that anyone else
%will understand.   Your usage of "empirical" (not "emperical") is
%equally idiosyncratic.  
%%oli4: we can complete the open interval with its limit point, and in
%%this sense it is an endpoint. I wrote it this way because you told
%%me to hide the fact that it's a limit.  I agree---the fact that it's
%%a limit is not relevant yet. 
%joe4*: After rewriting this sentence, I decided
% that we should cut it altogether.  How does knowing about all these
% distributions that also, in a sense, represent the PDG help our
% story?  To my mind, it just clutters it up.
%oli4: the point of this paragraph is to address the question 'what is inference for a PDG?' at a high level, and illustrate the subtlety.  We cannot simply leave the paragraph at "Our primary goal is to answer queries w.r.t. this dist" because the observational representative, while special in some important ways, may not be the only one we care about. And it's not the only one our paper addresses.
%joe5: I agree with your comment above.  I completely removed the
%emphasis on what your calling \obslimit, and rewrote the story.
  %oli4: So long as we're going to address the question, I think it's important not to give a
\newcommand{\commentout}[1]{}

of a continuous family of distributions that a PDG represents.
% which might be of interest.
%oli4 >moved> %joe4: I left in my rewrite so you can see it.
\discard{%
%oli4: I was trying to hide some irrelevant complexity in my version of this sentence with careful word chose. This rewrite is a little clearer, but also technically not quite right because, the semantics are a continuous parameterized family of _sets_ of distributions, in general. It happens that the set is a singleton for small parameter values and in the limit. Also, I don't think it's necessary to emphasize that this is a limit yet.
    Still, the  \obslimit\ is just the limit of a parameterized family of
    distributions all of can  be viewed as, in a sense, representing the PDG. }
Under stricter assumptions,
 % we show how to do inference with respect to these other distributions as well.
the same techniques enable inference with respect to some of these other distributions as well.

% subject to additional assumptions.
%joe4: added.  We need to argue that this distribution is reasonable.
%oli4*: this is not true for factor graphs. For factor graphs, the \gamma=1 semantics  captures the distribution of interest.  For BNs, all values of \gamma, including the limit, give the right distribution.  But for general PDGs, the \gamma=1 semantics may consist of many distributions.
%oli4: I'll just stay silent on factor graphs to avoid this discussion here.
% For the PDG that corresponds to a BN or FG, the \obslimit\ is just the distribution represented by the BN (resp., FG).
%joe5: said it above
%For the PDG that corresponds to a BN, these distributions are
%identical and coincide with the one represented by the BN.

  Since PDGs subsume BNs, and 
  inference for BNs is already NP-hard, the same
must be true of

%we're doing inference with respect to the same distributions, which I now did.

% The only hope for tractability is the same class of models
%joe5: why "at a high level"?
%At a high level, the best we could hope for would be tractability on

\Cref{sec:tw} for formal definitions).
%joe5
%That is precisely what we have.
That is indeed what we have.  More precisely, we show that for PDGs of
bounded treewidth, $*$-inference and $\gamma$-inference for a wide
range of $\gamma$ sufficiently close to 0 can be done in polynomial time.

%joe4
%Interestingly, the constriction is not trivial.
%oli4: I think the segue to the next bit is lost if we get rid of the "interestingly"; without it I would rather remove the sentence entirely.
%oli4: our contribution is the reduction, which ultimately yields an algorithm, but indirectly ---- so I'd prefer not to emphasize the algorithm. 
%The algorithm is not trivial.
% It is not a variant of belief propagation (BP), nor is it
% Unlike the many variants of exact inference

%Much better would be say "all use essentially the same underlying

%oli4: hmm, in retrospect, I'm not sure I want to say this at all; in some ways

% 
%oli4: Relevant Quote from Koller & Friedman, pg 382:
% "More broadly, each of these algorithms can be described from two perspectives: as a procedural description of a message passing algorithm, or as an optimization problem consisting of an objective and a constraint space. Historically, the message passing algorithm generally originated first, sometimes long before the optimization interpretation was understood. However, the optimization perspective provides a much deeper understanding of these methods, and it shows that message passing is only one way of performing the optimization; it also helps point the way toward useful generalizations.""

Our algorithm reduces inference in PDGs to conic exponential programming,
in a way that can be offloaded to powerful existing solvers.
We also provide a Python implementation of the conversion in a
standard convex optimization framework, giving users an
interface between such solvers and the standard PDG Python library.
Finally, we evaluate this implementation empirically, and show that it is both more accurate and faster than optimization baselines.

\section{PRELIMINARIES AND RELATED WORK}

\textbf{Notation.}
% This paper concerns the
% Unless otherwise specified, all scalar quantites range over the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% For us, a vector is a map from a finite set to the extended reals
%     $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
%joe4: I have never heard this terminology.  Since vectors are not
%functions, it seems to me very strange to talk about the domain of a
%vector.  Unless this is completely standard, please do not use this
%terminology.  in the sentence below, S is definitely *not* the domain
%of the vector.  People do not think of vectors as functions.  Why
%intrdocue nonstandard terminology that is (in my opinion) largely
%unnecessary.  It's a distraction for the reader.  I tried to tone it down.
%oli4: I'll concede that "domain" might be confusing in this context. 
% But the term "shape" is actually incredibly standard in machine
% learning. Not only  is this true in ML papers, but every numpy
% array, and every torch or tensorflow tensor %has a "shape" field.
%joe5: If it's standard to use the "shape" in this context, just as
%I've used structure, then it's OK to use shape.  But only if "shape"
%is used exactly in this way.
%oli4: your rewrite is a little more verbose less precise, and doesn't say what values the compnoents can take. I've it out, but I'll try to do the toning down myself.
%
%  We typically denote a vector $\mat u$ whose indices range over a set $S$ using
%  the notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$.  We say $S$ characterizes
%  \emph{structure} of vector $\mat u$.  Vectors with the same structure
%
For us, a vector is a map from some finite set $S$, called its \emph{shape}, to the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% The \emph{shape} of a vector $\mat u$ is the finite set which is its domain.
% The notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ defines a vector over the finite set $S$.
% The notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ defines a vector of shape $S$.
We write $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ to define a vector by its components.
\discard{\color{gray!30!white}
    We will sometimes use superscripts as well, especially when indices depend on one another. For example, if $\dg S$ is a finite set of finite sets, then
    %joe2: (1) why is this a disjoint union?  You never said that the sets in
    %\X were disjoint.  (2) You don't want to include X \in \X and x
    %\n X in the notation; it's really ugly.  I would slightly prefer
    %u_{x,X}$.  (3) Technically, if it's a vector, you have to specify the
    %order of the elements, and the notation doesn't do that.
    %oli2: (1) This is one construction of the disjoint union. It doesn't matter if the sets % X \in \X are disjoint; even if x is a member of X1 and X2, the indices (X1, x) and (X2,x) will be different.  (2) I agree that it's a little bit ugly, but I think leaving it out is far more confusing.  (3) Not necessarily.  Just because the standard basis (e_1, ... e_n) has an order doesn't mean we have to provide an order if we use a different basis. Sure, we need an order to write down a concrete vector without reference to the basis elements, but we won't need to do that.
    % $\mat u := [u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ defines a vector whose indicies range over the disjiont union $\sqcup \mathcal X$.
    %oli2: here's a compromise
    % $[u^X_x]_{x \in X, X \in \X}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    % for each $X \in \X$ and $x \in X$.
    $[u^S_s]^{S \in \dg S}_{s \in S}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    for each pair $(S,s)$, satisfying $s \in S \in \dg S$.
    By supplying just the upper index of such a vector, as in $\mat u^{S_0}$,
    we mean $[u^{S_0}_s]_{s \in {S_0}}$, the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace whose upper index is $S_0$.

%use nonstandard notation.  (I understand it's not completelhy
%nonstandard, but I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of
%books/papers denote inner product using a dot.  Why different?
%oli4: I think actually the standard is much more heavily towards the transpose
% in numerical methods, conic convex optimization, and in ML generally.  That said, 
% I have no problem using \cdot, but we also use the transpose once for a matrix

% Every variable $X$ can take on values from a finite set $\V\mskip-1mu X$ of possible values.
Every variable $X$ can take on values from a finite set $\V\mskip-1.5mu X$ of possible values.
% Sets (and tuples) of variables $\mat X = \{X_1, \ldots X_n\}$ are also variables,

% Tuples of variables are also variables in the usual way, with

% Sets of variables are also variables in the usual way, with
%joe4: we do we need/wnat this?  It will cause real problems if we
%explicitly describe the set of variables, as we do for PDGs.
%oli4: What problems does it cause? Making this definition allows us to state a lot of 
% things without so much overhead: joint settings over all variables, values of a cluster, etc.. We make use of it all over the place.  Reinstated for now.  If we really need to avoid it, the notation will need a significant rework and become more lengthy. 
%joe5: We define a PDG by the variables used.  If sets of variables
%are also variables, then a PDG has many more variables.  We really
%don't want to go there.
%Sets of variables $\mat X$ are variables themselves, with
We can use analogous notation for sets of variables, writing
$\V \mat X = \Pi_{X \in \mat X} \V X$.
A conditional probability distribution (cpd) $p(Y|X)$ is a map
%joe2
%$p : \V(X) \to \Delta \V(Y)$, so it assigns, to every $x \in \V(X)$, a
$p : \V\mskip-1.5mu  X \to \Delta \V Y$, so it assigns to each $x \in \V\mskip-1.5mu X$ a
probability distribution $p(Y|x) \in \Delta \V Y$, which is shorthand for $p(Y|X\!\!=\!x)$.
%joe4
% Given a joint distribution $\mu$ over many variables including both $X$ and $Y$,
Given a distribution $\mu$ over (the values of) a set of variables including both $X$ and $Y$,
%joe1: Is this standard notation for a marginal?  \mu)(X) looks like
%the probability of X to me.
%oli1: I'm pretty sure it's standard; at the very least, it agrees with the standard notation:  If you had Pr(X,Y), and you wanted to talk about the probability of X, you would write Pr(X), which is also the marginal of the distribution \Pr.
%joe4*: But who write \mu(X,Y) to denote a distribution on X and Y?
%That seems equally nonstandard (and is *horrible* notation), because
%it makes it hard to distinguish that probabiity of X=x from a probability on X.
%oli4*: I must be understanding what you think is nonstanard.  People
%write P(X,Y), q(X,Y), or \mu(X,Y) to denote a joint distribution on X
%and Y all the time.  It's what Koller & Friedman do, it's Pearl's
%notation, and it's also standard in ML.
%joe5: I'll check K&F.  I would have hoped they would know better!
% I also don't understand the difficulty in distinguishing the probability of X=x from a probability on X.  If X is a variable, then \mu(X=x), is the probability that X=x, and \mu(X) is the marginal on X. 
we write $\mu(X)$ for its marginal distribution on $X$,
% $\mu(X,Y)$ for the
and $\mu(Y|X)$ for the cpd obtained by first conditioning on $X$ and then marginalizing to $Y$.
We measure information in a distribution with entropy $\H(\mu) := \Ex_{\mu} [\log \frac1\mu]$ and conditional entropy $\H_\mu(Y|X) := \Ex_\mu[\log\nicefrac1{\mu(Y|X)}]$, where $X$ and $Y$ are variables.

%joe2: what's the INTUITION for a hyperedge?
%oli2: I don't get why this is necessary. At this point it's just an analogue of a
% graph. Would you want me to give intuition for what an edge of a graph means in
% general, if it were slightly less standard?  It's useful generally.
A hypergraph $G = (V, \Ed)$ is a set $V$ of vertices, and a collection $\Ed$ of \emph{hyperedges}, which correspond to subsets of $V$.

    A \emph{directed hypergraph} $G = (N, \mathcal A)$ is a set $N$ of nodes, and a collection $\mathcal A$ of \emph{(hyper)arcs}; each $a \in \mathcal A$
    is associated with a set $\Src a \subset N$ of source nodes, and a set $\Tgt a \subset N$ target nodes.
\end{defn}
% A directed graph is just a directed hypergraph where the source and target sets of every hyperarc are singletons.
A directed graph can be seen a directed hypergraph in which every source and target set is a singleton.

% We can form a hypergraph from a directed hypergraph
%joe4: why do we need this?  We should focus on what we need in this paper
%oli4: we actually do need it, technically: we define tree decompositions 
% for hypergraphs because that's how it's done in the literature, but this paper
% deals with tree decompositions of PDGs, which are directed hyper-graphs. Although it's
% pretty clear what that means intuitively, this observation makes that intuition precise.
In turn, a directed hypergraph can be seen as a hypergraph
by taking the union of the source and target sets,
thereby ``forgetting the direction of the arrow''.
% There is also a natural bijection between directed hypergraphs and directed bipartite graphs.

% Given a hyper-graph $(\X, \Ed)$,
Many problems that are intractable for general graphs
are tractable for trees, and
% By merging adjacent nodes, every graph may be converted to to a tree, but

A tree decomposition of a (hyper)graph $G = (V, \Ed)$ is a tree $(\mathdcal C, \mathcal T)$ whose vertices $C \in \mathdcal C$, called

The \emph{width} of a tree decomposition is one less than the size of its largest cluster,
and the \emph{treewidth} of a (hyper)graph $G$ is the smallest possible width of any tree decomposition of $G$.
It is NP-hard to determine the tree-width of a graph, but if the tree-width is known to be bounded above, a tree decomposition may be constructed in linear time \parencite{bodlaender1993linear}.

which has the property that $\Pr_{\bmu}(C) = \mu_C$ for $C \in \mathdcal C$.
To see why this summarizes query information in a simple case, note that if $Y$ is contained in a single cluster $C$, then $\mu_C(Y) = \Pr_{\bmu}(Y) = \Pr_{\cal M}(Y | X \!=\! x)$.
Note also that, in the extreme case where $\mathdcal C$ contains only one cluster with all variables, a clique tree is just a joint distribution, and distils inference about probabilistic queries in the sense that finding any marginal distributions amounts to computing a sum.

\begin{defn}
%joe4; why not {\bf p} rather than \mathcal P; this would be more consistent notation
%oli4*: I had the same instinct a while back. That is the notation we had in our first
% paper. Here, the notation emphasizes a view of {\bf p} as a vector. Because we restrict
% to discrete variables, that is technically a reasonable thing to do here. 
% but also the indices are more complicated than you suggested with your rewrite. I think
% there's less potential for misunderstanding if we don't try to think of the cpds as
% vectors until right before we need to as a convex program. Otherwise, therere are a lot
% of technical ambiguities we need to be careful of --- like, what is \mu(X) p(Y|X)? 
% Because of that, I'm reverting to my original notation.
%joe5*: I'm sorry;  I don't get it.  You write \mathcal P, and never
  %explain what it is.  You write p_\alpha, which is your notation for
  %a component of a vector p, but never explain what p is, and how it
  %differs from \mathcal P.  (If it does, then I'm completely
  %mystified as to how.)  I don't   %understand your concerns above,
  %and I'm quite sure that the reader will find what you wrote far
  %more confusing that what I wrote.   Unless you can explain to the
  %reader (as well as to me, of course) why you insist on violating
  %your own notational conventions, you should change it back.  (I'll
  %probably want you to change it back after you've explained it as
  %well; this is simply far too confusing.)   Here is yet another
  %example of when our sense of what a reader will find confusing
  %diverge, and where I find your viewpoint highly idiosyncractic.
  A PDG $\dg M = (\X, \Ar, \mathcal P, \balpha, \bbeta )

    % each $L \in \Ed$ of which is associated with:
%joe2: we didn't talk about hypergraphs in the AAAI paper.  Do you
%talk about them in the AIStats paper?
%oli2: no, this is a different presentation. I think it's cleaner in this
% case because I already had to bring up the hyper-graphs to talk about
% tree decompositions intelligently.
    is a directed hypergraph  $(\X, \Ar)$, whose nodes correspond to variables,
%joe4:
% ${\bf p} = [p]_{a \in \Ar}$,
%oli4: Here's the first place we start to get into the problems I alluded to earlier. 
% The notation you introduced on the previous line doesn't quite
% work. p_a is not a number, but rather a conditional probability
    % distribution (or, if you prefer, a vector).
    %joe5: Why is that a problem?  Who said that a vector had to be a
    %vector of numbers?  Actually, looking back at it, you did.  But
    %there's nothing in the mathematical theory of vector spaces that
    %requires this.  I woudl drop this requirement.
%oli4: we haven't said what alpha or beta are yet, so this isn't the
%right place to give their vector notation. I'm moving the following
    %two lines to where they were before.

        % \item subsets $\Src L, \Tgt L \subset \X$, which are source and target variables of the edge $L$. For example,

First, we have to talk about how this isn't too restrictive for factor graphs which require \alpha=\beta.

For instance, if we simulate \alpha=2 by adding a second edge edge with \beta=0 and \alpha=1, we no longer have \bbeta > 0.

$\mathcal P$.
%joe5
The weight vectors $\alpha$ and $\beta$ encode our confidence in these
two types of information.
%joe5: cut nrext line; it's redubndant
%Corresponding to these two types of information, 
% we have two loss functions, which associate with a measure
% $\mu$ how far $\mu$ is from capturing each of these two types of

%PDG semantics are based on two scoring functions

The semantics of PDGs are based on two scoring functions
that quantify the discrepancy between 
a joint distribution $\mu$ over (the possible values of) the variables
in $\X$,
and each of the two types of information.

%oli4: pulling this into your previous paragraph; going to start differently now.

%oli4: I think your version is clunkier than mine. It's not a
%distance, so you need quotes, while "discrepancy" is accurate. The
%words "can be viewed as" also are an unnecessary hedge in my
%opinion. Why use the precise word nonstandardly with quotes? It
%measures the discrepancy (even if there are other ways to measure
%it).
%joe5: While I can live with "dxiscrepancy", I suspect most people will
%think of this as measuring how far \mu is from matching the PDG.
%"How far" means that we have a distance.  The fact that your actual
%loss function isn't a metric is to me a problem with your loss
%function, not with the intuition that we're describig a distance.  I

%In any case, in what sense is "discrepancy" accurate?

%joe2: It's strange to talk about the quantitative term, since it's
%nota term in any expression that you've defined

The second scoring function measures
structural discrepancy between $\mu$ and $\dg M$:
%joe4: I *really* don't like this.  I don't know what it means for \mu
%to "fail to arise", and talking about units of \alpha is horrible.
%oli4: I concede that "fails to arise" is a little clunky. But I
%actually really liked the description in terms of units of
%\alpha. It's simultaneously one of the shortest and also the most
%accurate ways I've written this down---and we've been rewriting this
%bit for years now.  What's wrong with "units of alpha"?
%joe5: For those of us who think of \alpha as a measure of confidence,

%joe5*: Yuck!  I really don't like "for each unit of \alpha", and
%would far prefer to think of \alpha as being in [0k1].  This is simply

%much more natural to think of the weight as being in [0,1].  I have

%joe4: Now that I understand \alpha better, I think "information
%deficiency" is a terrible name.  I'd really like to say that Inc
%measures the observational incompatibility and Idef measures the
%causal incompatibility, or something like that.
%oli4*: I actually agree, and your proposal makes a lot of sense to
%me. However, perhaps we would be better off reserving "causal
%incompatibility" for the variant IDef' which cannot be negative and
%(if my conjecture is right) is more closely related to our notion of
%qualitative independence. I've left this alone for now.
%joe5*: I still really object to "deficiency".  Please change it to
%incompatibility.  I'm extremely uncomfortable with it being
%negative.  I have no intuition for that, and you've never given me any.

% high weight to the observations (hence the name, if you call it

% respect to a PDG, whe mean with respect to this semantics.  However,
% many of our results also hold for all the (unique) distribution in
% [[M]]^*_\gamma if \gamma is sufficiently small.  We call this
% gamma-inference. With gamma-inference, we give more weight to the causal
% mechanisms encoded by a PDG.  [But you should make clear that we are
% taking [[M]]^* as "the" semantics of a PDG, adn causal inference is
% with respect to this semantics.  If you don't do that, the story
% starts getting muddled.]

%oli4: 
% becaues we're no longer not trying to take [[M]]^* as THE semantics of a PDG, 
% and we've expaned more on the meaning of \gamma above, I think the first part of this
% paragraph doesn't require as big a rewrite as you suggest. I've made some minor
% tweaks to bring it in line with your comments, and split it in two.
% As for assuming $\bbeta > 0$, I'm hesitent because there's not a good place to clear

% is a nice parallel with the \beta > \gamma \alpha condition above.

%doesn't have your deep understanding, will be mystified.
% For now, I've swapped the footnote and the text.

One natural conception of inference in PDGs is then parameterized by $\gamma$:
% $\gamma$-inference for $\dg M$ means responding to probabilistic queries in a way that is sound with respect to every $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$.
to do $\gamma$-inference in $\dg M$ is to respond to probabilistic queries in a way that is sound with respect to every $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$.
%joe4*: this is a perfectly reasonable thing to say, but is premature,
%and is too rushed.  Before you say it, you should point out that we
%get strict conviexity if \beta \ge \gamma \alpha, and explain why.
%This paper demonstrates
%that $\gamma$-inference is tractable for PDGs satisfying $\bbeta \ge
%\gamma \balpha$, which is sufficient to ensure strict convexity of
%\eqref{eqn:scoring-fn}, and hence a unique optimal distribution.

%oli4: merging paragraphs
One should be careful to distinguish $\bbr{\dg M}^* \in \Delta\mskip-2mu \V \mskip-2mu\X$,

$\OInc_{\dg M}$; the latter set can be shown to contain $\bbr{\dg
  M}^*$ (see \cite{pdg-aaai}),
but may also contain other distributions.
%oli4: adding a bit on inference to tie it all together:
%joe5*: I cut this.  I see no reason that it should be our main
%objective any more.  We haven't motivated it.  We can call this
%*-inference, and also talk about \gamma-inference. No need to
%introduce yet another bit of new terminlogy (which woudl conflict
%with \gamme-inference in any case.
%One of our main objective is to answering queries with respect to
%$\bbr{\dg M}^*$, which we call \emph{$\epsilon$-inference},  
%%oli4: this might be a bit much, but also could be helpful:
%since it coincides with $\gamma$-inference for $\gamma$ equal to an
%infinitessimal number $\epsilon$. 


%joe4*: I cut this paragraph from here.  This notation should be
% introduced where you first use it.  It muddles the story
% here. There's no need to say that <<M>> is the standard loss function
% used in learning settings; that has nothing to do with our story.
%oli4: The secondary thread of our story is that we can compute << M >>, the inconsistency.  I think this is a sufficiently important concept that it demands definition here; proposition 1 seems like an inappropriate place to make this definition to me, because one might skip over proposition 1, and really this is core background material about PDGs. 
% As for being a loss function, I'll grant that, we've already said as  much about why we care about it, but I thought it would be good to follow up on this now that we can talk about it more formally.
% All that said, the middle notational part of this paragraph seems a little irrelevant;
% we can get away with less. 
%oli4: this whole paragraph is being rewritten
The smallest possible numerical value of the scoring function attained by any  distribution,
\begin{align*}
    \aar{\dg M}_\gamma := \inf_{\mu \in \Delta\!\V\!\X}\, \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu),
\end{align*}
is known as the $\gamma$-inconsistency of $\dg M$, and is interesting in its own right.
%oli4: removing the bit on notation
% To parallel the notation for scoring functions,
% when $\gamma$ is omitted or we write ``the inconsistency of $\dg M$'',
% we are referring to the limit as $\gamma\to 0$, which, unlike before, obeys
%  % $\aar{\dg M} = \aar{\dg M}_0$.

But the constraints that these methods can handle are insufficient for
our purposes. We need what have been called \emph{exponential cone constraints}.

The \emph{exponential cone} is the convex set

%oli4: I agree that it fits well there, but I think it's also important to say something like this here; we've just introduced the exponential cone and I'm giving you the intuition you keep asking for! 
% Also, its a very standard construction and putting it later on makes it seem less like

{\color{gray!50!white} It is also sometimes called the relative entropy cone, because if $\mat m, \mat p \in \Delta^{n-1} \subset \mathbb R^n$ are points on a probability simplex, then $(-\mat u, \mat m, \mat p) \in K_{\exp}^n$ if and only if $\mat u$ is an upper bound on $\mat m \log (\nicefrac{\mat m}{\mat p})$, the pointwise contribution to relative entropy at each outcome.}

%oli4: being a little more explicit.
% As one might expect, 
$K_{\exp}^n \subset \smash{\Rext}\vphantom{R}^{3n}$ denotes the cartesian product

An \emph{exponential conic program} is an optimization problem of the form

 the function $\mat x \mapsto \mat c^{\sf T} \mat x$ is called the \emph{objective},

relative entropy:

a probability simplex,

% In particular, if the source of an arc $a \in \Ar$ can take $m := |\V\Src a|$

Choose a root node $C_0$ of the tree decomposition $\mathcal T$, and orient each edge of $\mathcal T$ so that it points away from $C_0$.
Now each cluster $C \in \cal C$, except for $C_0$, has a parent cluster $\Par_C$;
define $\Par_{C_0} := \emptyset$ to be an empty cluster, since $C_0$ has no parent.
Finally, for each $C \in \mathdcal C$, let $\Pash_C := C \mathbin{\cap} \Par_C$ denote the

Note that the denominator $\mu_C(\Pash_C)$ is an affine transformation of $\mu_C$.

splits as a sum of terms over the clusters, each of which can be captured as a dcp exponential cone constraint.

\subsection{Comparison To Belief propagation}

Since PDGs generalize other graphical models, one might wonder how our method stacks up against them.
We benchmarked against the small networks, and some of the medium-sized ones, from the \href{https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/}{\texttt{bnlearn}} repository.



\subsection{Evaluations On Random PDGSs}
We start by focusing on empirical properties of the optimization over joint distributions.

We generated several hundred PDGs with various properties: 9 or 10 variables, each of which can take 2-3 values. Each PDG contains 7-15 hyperedges, with 1-2 target nodes and 0-3 source nodes. The cpds are chosen by taking uniformly random numbers from [0,1] and normalizing appropriately, and every $\beta$ is set to 1.
For each PDG $\dg M$, we measure its complexity by:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \texttt{n\_edges}, the number of edges in $\dg M$,
    \item \texttt{n\_params}, the total number of parameters across all the cpds of $\dg M$, and
    \item \texttt{n\_worlds}, the size of the joint distributions on the variables of $\dg M$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Capacity.}
The black-box py-torch based approaches clearly have an edge in that they can handle larger models; see the cut-offs on the right sides of \cref{fig:resources,fig:gap-resource-fine}.

\textbf{Resource Costs.}
Look at \cref{fig:resources}.
Note that the exponential cone methods without the CCCP (blue and
green) are actually faster than LBFGS, which was the best-performing
%joe5: did you mean "py-torch"?
torch optimizer. 
However, they use \emph{significantly} more memory, and cannot handle
more than 8000 worlds. 


\textbf{Accuracy.}
In addition to being faster, the exponential cone techniques are also
%joe5
%more preicse.
more precise. 
Note that the CCCP is typically more precise than the black-box optimizers when the problem is fully convex $\gamma \le 1$, and mirrors the performance of the exp-cone algorithms for the quantitative limit on the left, in blue.  For combinations of larger $\gamma$ and more worlds however, the 20 iteration maximum we imposed is not nearly enough to get convergence, and the black-box optimizers are both faster and attain better objective values.

%joe5*: this section should be cut.  At best, you can add a few
%sentences in the conlusion that discusses these results.
\section{OTHER APPROACHES TO PDG INFERENCE} \label{sec:other-inference}
% \section{EXTENSIONS}


\subsection{}
A stronger result than \cref{prop:markov-property} holds as well.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:same-set-dists}
    % For all $\gamma > 0$ and in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$,
    Let $\Ed$ be a set of (hyper)edges over $\X$.
    For every PDG $\dg M$ over $\X$ with edges $\Ed$, every $\gamma > 0$, and every optimum $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ of $\dg M$'s scoring function at $\gamma$,
    there is a factor graph $\Phi$ with factors along $\Ed$ such that $\Pr_\Phi = \mu^*$.
\end{prop}

In other words: every distribution that a PDG can pick out as optimal (for any choice of $\gamma > 0$ and also in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$), can also be described as a factor graph with the same structure as that PDG.
How do we square this with the \citeauthor{pdg-aaai}'s claim that PDGs are more general than factor graphs?

% This may be surprising, given how \citeauthor{pdg-aaai} position their model as strictly more expressive than other graphical models, because it implies that the optimal distribution
\TODO[TODO: answer this question.\\
    The short answer: PDGs still compose differently, and in a way that respects the meaning of the probabilities. And just because you can find a factor graph that would have given you the right distribution after the fact, doesn't mean you could have specified the component factors.]
% The answer is simply that


\TODO[Also: don't get lost; figure out how to continue as below:]
\cref{prop:same-set-dists} suggests another approach to avoiding an exponential representation of $\mu$: given a PDG, fit a factor graph that has the same structure to it.

\subsection{Approximate Inference}
% \subsubsection{Relaxing the Marginal Polytope}
\textbf{Relaxing the marginal polytope.}
Just as it is possible to do belief propagation on cluster graphs that are not trees (e.g., loopy belief propagation)
so too is it possible to drop the requirement that the cluster that we use is indeed a tree decomposition.
This program is smaller, and will converge, but it will only be an approximate solution.
Like the original PDG itself, it might be inconsistent.

\subsubsection{Variational Approaches}

% Because of the deep connection between variational approaches

\section{DISCUSSION}

% Our anaysis
Our analysis shows that inference in PDGs with bounded tree-width can be done .


% \TODO[ the below is a transplant without context; fix it ]
% % Some queries are more difficult than others.
% Although we the question the same way, we also want to point out that there are other reasonable ways to answer that question once we move to PDGs.
% Suppose we were looking at a BN in which it just so happens that $\mat X$ contains only a single variable and $\mat Y$ are the parents of $\mat X$.
% In this case, our representation already contains the probabilities we are looking for, and we would be happy returning that row of the conditional probability table.
% But in a PDG, that cpd $p(\mat Y \,|\,\mat X)$, even if it is the only one
% attached to an edge from $X$ to $Y$, may not be the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
% As a consequence,


There are still a number of open questions.

    \item What if $\bbeta < \gamma \balpha$?

	% First, we deal with the convexity, for which we make use of \cref{lem:cvx2}.

	% 		&= f
	% 	\end{align*}
	% }
	We start by expanding the definitions, obtaining
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma &= \inf_\mu ~\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma(\mu) \\
			&= \inf_\mu \left[ \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu)
				+ \Ex_{x\sim\mu_{\!_X}} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(Y\mid x)}{p(Y\mid x)} \right]\\
			&= \inf_\mu \left[ \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu)
				+  \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(X,Y)}{p(Y \mid X)\, \mu(X)} \right].
	\end{align*}
	% % Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.
	% Since $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ is a $\gamma$-strongly convex function of $\mu$ for all
	% such $\gamma < \min_L \beta_L$, and
	% $\kldiv{\mu_{XY}}{\mu_X \; p_{Y\mid X}}$ is 1-strongly
	% convex in $p$ for fixed $\mu$ (\cref{lem:Dstrongcvx}),
	% % $\thickD$ is convex in both of its arguments,

	% 	+  \kldiv[\big]{\mu_{XY}}{p_{Y \mid X}\; \mu_X} \right]
	% $, which equals $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$,
	% is $\gamma$-strongly convex in $p$.
	% % $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$ is smooth
	% % Smoothness.


	% Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.
	Fix $\gamma < \min_L \beta_L$. Then we know that $\bbr{\dg X}_\gamma(\mu)$ is a $\gamma$-strongly convex function for every PDG $\dg X$, and hence there is a unique joint distribution which minimizes it.

	\textbf{Strict Convexity.}
	Suppose $p_1(Y \mid X)$ and $p_2(Y\mid X)$ are two cpds on $Y$ given $X$.
	Fix $\lambda \in [0,1]$, and set $p_\lambda = (1-\lambda) p_1 + \lambda p_2$.
	Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ and $\mu_\lambda$ be the joint distributions that minimze $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_1}_\gamma$, $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_2}_\gamma$ and $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma$, respectively.  Then we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma
			= \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(X,Y)}{p_\lambda(Y\mid X) \mu_\lambda( X)}.
	\end{equation*}
	By convexity of $\bbr{\dg M}$ and $\thickD$, we have
	\begin{align}
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda)
		 	&\le (\lambda-1)\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1) + \lambda \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	\label{eqn:score-cvx}\\
		\text{and}\qquad \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)}
			&\le (1-\lambda)\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \nonumber \\
			&\qquad+ \lambda\;\;\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}.
				\label{eqn:D-cvx}
	\end{align}
	If $\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ then since $\bbr{\dg M}$ is strictly convex, \eqref{eqn:score-cvx} must
	be a strict inequality. On the other hand, if $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, then since $\mu_\lambda = \mu_1 = \mu_2$ and $\thickD$ is stricly convex in its second argument when its first argument is fixed (\Cref{lem:Dstrongcvx}), \eqref{eqn:D-cvx} must be a strict inequality.
	In either case, the sum of the two inequalities must be strict, giving us
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma &=
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)} \\
		&<
		 (\lambda-1) \left[\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \right]
			 \\[-0.3em]&\qquad\qquad
			 + \lambda \left[ \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}
			 	\right] \\
		 &= (\lambda-1) \aar{\dg M \bundle p_1} + \lambda\,\aar{\dg M \bundle p_2},
	\end{align*}
	which shows that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}$ is \emph{strictly} convex in $p$, as desired.


	\textbf{Smoothness.}
	If $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*$ is a positive distribution, then by definition $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}$ achieves its minimum on the interior of the probability simplex $\Delta \V(\dg M \bundle p)$, and so by \Cref{lem:cvx4}, we immediately find that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$ is smooth in $p$.

	Now, suppose that $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*(\mat w) = 0$,  for some $\mat w \in \V(\dg M \bundle p)$.

	Applying \Cref{lem:cvx4} to the function $f = \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$

	Now for the second case.

	\TODO

	If $x^*_b \in \partial X$, then we claim that either
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item There is a subspace $T \subseteq \mathbb R^{m}$ with
			$\SD{}$
	 	\item There is a subspace $S \subseteq \mathbb R^{n}$ with
			$x^*_b \in S \cap \partial X$ such

	\end{enumerate}

\end{lproof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cvx4}
	Let $X$ and $Y$ be convex sets, and
	$f : X \times Y \to \mathbb R$ be a smooth $(C^\infty)$, convex function.
	If $f$ is strictly convex in $X$, and for some $y_0 \in Y$, $f(x, y_0)$ achieves its infemum on the interior of $X$.
	then $y\mapsto \inf_x f(x, y)$ is smooth $(C^\infty)$ at the point $y_0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lproof}%[Proof of \Cref{lem:cvx4}]
	% Let $f_y(x) = f(x,y)$.
	% Since $f$ is smooth and stritly convex, each restriction $f_y$ of $f$ to a
	% particular $y$ is also smooth and strictly convex.
	% As a result, each $f_y$ has a unique minimum $m_y := \inf_{x} f_y(x)$.
	% As $f_y$ is smooth, $m_y$ is either a boundary point, or
	% at a point where $\nabla f_y = 0$.
	%
	% Moreover, it is a constrained optimization problem, so
	% $\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} [ f(x,y) + \lambda (y_0 - y)] = 0$.
	%
	% \TODO
	Let $x_0^* := \arg\min_x f(x,y_0)$, which is achieved by assumption, and is unique because $f(-,y_0)$ is strictly convex.

	We will ultimately apply the implicit function theorem to give us a smooth function which is equal to this infemum, but to do so we must deal with the technicality that it requires an open set; the boundary is the most complicated part of this result.
	Here we have essentially required that the domain be open by fiat for $X$, but for $Y$ (which is a possibly non-open subset of $\mathbb R^m$), we use the Extension Lemma for smooth functions \cite[Lemma 2.26]{Lee.SmoothManifolds}. In our context, it states that
	for every open set $U$ with $\overline{Y} \subseteq U \subseteq \mathbb R^m$,
	there exists a function $\tilde f : X \times \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb R$, such that $\tilde f |_{Y} = f$ (and $\supp \tilde f \subseteq U$).
	We only need a small fraction of this power: that we can smoothly extend $f$ to \emph{some} open set of $\mathbb R^m$, which we fix and call $\tilde Y$.

	% Similarly, for other $y \in Y$, let $x^*_y$ be the unique value of $x$ which minimizes $f(x,y)$.

	% \textbf{Smoothness.}
	% By assumption, $x^*_b$ is not a boundary point of $X$.
	%
	We claim that now all conditions for the Implicit Function Theorem are met if invoked with
		$\phi(y,x) := \vec\nabla_x \tilde f(x,y)$ and $(\mat b,\mat a) = (y_0, x^*_0)$.
	Concretely, we have $m = \mathop{dim} X$, $n = \mathop{dim} Y$, and $Z = (\tilde Y \times X)^\circ$, i.e., the interior of $\tilde Y \times X$, which is open and contains $(\mat b, \mat a)$.
	 Becuase $\phi$ is smooth, it is $k$-times differentiable for all $k$. We have $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f (y_0, x^*_0) = \vec 0$ because $x^*_0$ is a local minimum of the smooth function $\tilde f(-, y_0)$ which lies on the interior of $X$.

	Moreover, the Jacobian matrix
	\[ \mat J_{\nabla\!\tilde f, x}(y_0, x_0^*) = \left[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x^*_0, y_0) \right]\]
	is the Hessian of the strictly convex funtion $f(-, b)$, and therefore positive definite (and in particular non-singular).
	Therefore, the Implicit Function Theorem guarantees us the existence of a neighborhood $U \subset \tilde Y$ of $y_0$ for which
	there is a unique $k$-times differentiable function $g: U \to X$ such that $g(y_0) = x^*_0$ and $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f(y, g(y)) = 0$ for all $y \in U$. Of course, this implies $g(y) = \argmin_x f(x,y)$ at every such point, and $\inf_x f(x,y) = f(g(y),y)$ is a composition of the smooth function $f$ with the $k$-times differentiable function $g \otimes \mathrm{id}_Y$.
	Therefore, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is itself $k$-times continuously differentiable at $y_0$ for all $k$, or in other words, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is smooth at $y=y_0$.

			encoding the boolean OR function (i.e., the truth of $C_j$ given $\{X_{j,i}\}$);
		\item an edge $\pdgunit \tto C_j$, together with a cpd asserting $C_j$ be equal to 1.
	\end{itemize}
	% We give each edge $\alpha = 0$ and $\beta = 1$.
	First, note that the number of nodes, edges, and non-zero entries in the cpds are polynomial in the $|\mathcal J|, |\mat X|$, and the total number of parameters in a simple matrix representation of the cpds is also polynomial if $\mathcal I$ is bounded (e.g., if $\varphi$ is a 3-CNF formula).
	A satisfying assignment $\mat x \models \varphi$ of the variables $\mat X$ can be regarded as a degenerate joint distribution $\delta_{\mat X = \mat x}$ on $\mat X$, and extends uniquely to a full joint distribution $\mu_{\mat x} \in \Delta \V(\dg M_\varphi)$ consistent with all of the edges, by
	\[ \mu_{\mat x} = \delta_{\mat x} \otimes \delta_{\{C_j = \vee_i  x_{j,i}\}} \]

 	Conversely, if $\mu$ is a joint distribution consistent with the edges above, then any point $\mat x$ in the support of $\mu(\mat X)$ must be a satisfying assignment, since the two classes of edges respectively ensure that $1 =\mu(C_j\!=\! 1 \mid \mat X \!=\! \mat x) = \bigvee_{i \in \mathcal I(j)} \mat x_{j,i}$ for all $j \in \mathcal J$, and so $\mat x \models \varphi$.

	Thus, $\SD{\dg M_\varphi} \ne \emptyset$ if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable, so
	an algorithm for determining if a PDG is consistent can also be adapted (in polynomial space and time) for use as a SAT solver, and so the problem of determining if a PDG consistent is NP-hard.

	\textbf{PART (b).}
    We prove this by reduction to \#SAT. Again, let $\varphi$ be some CNF formula over $\mat X$, and construct
	$\dg M_\varphi$ as in \hyperref[proof:consistent-NP-hard]{the proof} of
	\Cref{prop:consistent-NP-hard}.
	Furthemore, let $\bbr{\varphi} := \{ \mat x : \mat x \models \varphi \}$ be the set of  assingments to $\mat X$ satisfying $\varphi$, and $\#_\varphi := |\bbr{\dg M}|$ denote the number such assignments. We now claim that
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:number-of-solns}
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right].
	\end{equation}
 	If true, we would have a reduced the \#P-hard problem of computing $\#_\varphi$ to the problem of computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma$. We now proceed with proof \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns}.
	By definition, we have
	\[ \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = \inf_\mu \Big[ \OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) + \gamma \CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \Big]. \]
	We start with a claim about first term.
	% For the particular PDG $\dg M_\varphi$, the

	\begin{iclaim} \label{claim:separate-inc-varphi}
		% $\OInc(\dg M_\varphi)$ is finite if and only if $\varphi$ is statisfiable.
		$\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) =
		% \begin{cases}
		% 	0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
		% 	 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
		% 	\infty & \text{otherwise}
		% \end{cases}
		\begin{cases}
			0 & \text{if}~  \supp \mu \subseteq \bbr{\varphi} \times \{ \mat 1\} \\
			\infty & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}$.
	\end{iclaim}
	\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{lproof}
		Writing out the definition explicitly, the first can be written as
		\begin{equation}
			\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = \sum_{j} \left[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j)}{\delta_1} +
				\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_{j,i}}} \right], \label{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}
				% &= \sum_{j} \left[
				% 	\begin{matrix} \mu(C_j\!=\!0) (\infty) \\
				% 	 	+ \mu(C_j \!=\! 1) \log \mu(C_j \!=\! 1)
				% 	\end{matrix} +
				% 	\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_i}} \right],
		\end{equation}
		where $\mat X_j = \{X_{ij} : j \in \mathcal I(j)\}$ is the set of variables that
		appear in clause $j$, and $\delta_{(-)}$ is the probability distribution placing all mass on the point indicated by its subscript.
		As a reminder, the relative entropy is given by
		\[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\nu(\Omega)} := \Ex_{\omega \sim \mu} \log \frac{\mu(\omega)}{\nu(\omega)},
		\quad\parbox{1.4in}{\centering and in particular, \\ if $\Omega$ is binary,}\quad
			\kldiv[\big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\delta_\omega} = \begin{cases}
				0 &  \text{if}~\mu(\omega) = 1 ; \\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}.
		\end{cases} \]
		Applying this to \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}, we find that either:
		\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
			\item Every term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is finite (and zero) so $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$, which happens when $\mu(C_j = 1) = 1$ and $\mu(C_j = \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) = 1$ for all $j$.  In this case, $\mat c = \mat 1 = \{ \vee_i~x_{j,i} \}_j$ so $\mat x \models \varphi$ for every $(\mat{c,x}) \in \supp \mu$;
			\item Some term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is infinite, so that $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = \infty$, which happens if some $j$, either

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\mu(C_j \ne 1) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,c}) \in \supp \mu$ with $\mat c \ne 1$, or
				\item $\supp \mu(\mat C) = \{\mat 1\}$, but $\mu(C_j \ne \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,1}) \in \supp \mu$ for which $1 = c_j \ne \vee_i~x_{j,i}\;$, and so $\mat x \not\models \varphi$.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		Condensing and rearranging slightly, we have shown that
		\[
			\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
			\begin{cases}
				0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
				 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases}~.
		\]
		% So if $\mat x \models \varphi$ for all $\mat x \in \supp \mu(X)$,
		%
		% $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$
		% The first term is infinite if $\mu(C_j = 1) < 1$, and the second is infinite
		% if $\mu(C_j = \lor_i X_{i,j}) < 1$. Thus, if $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then $\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X)$ satisfies $\varphi$ with probability 1, and $\varphi$ must be satisfiable.
		% Conversely,
	\end{lproof}

	% Thus, if $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then every $\mat x \in \supp \mu$ is a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$.
	Because $\CDef_{}$ is bounded, it follows immediately that
 	$\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, is finite if and only if
	there is some distribution $\mu \in \Delta\V(\mat X,\mat C)$ for which $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, or equivalently, by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, iff there exists some $\mu(\mat X) \in \Delta \V(\mat X)$ for which $\supp \mu(\mat X) \subseteq \bbr{\varphi}$, which in turn is true if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable.

	In particular, if $\varphi$ is not satisfiable (i.e., $\#_\varphi = 0$), then $\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = +\infty$, and
	\[
		\exp \left[ -\frac1\gamma \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma \right] =
	 		\exp [ - \infty ] = 0 = \#_\varphi,
	\]
	so in this case \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns} holds as promised. On the other hand, if $\varphi$ \emph{is} satisfiable, then, again by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, every $\mu$ minimizing $\bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, (i.e., every $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma^*$) must be supported entirely on $\bbr{\varphi}$ and have $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = 0$.  As a result, we have
	\[
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma =
			\inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]} \gamma\; \CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) .
	\]
	A priori, by the definition of $\CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}$, we have
	\[
		\CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
		 	- \H(\mu) + \sum_{j} \Big[ \alpha_{j,1} \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j)
						+ \alpha_{j,0} \H_\mu(C_j) \Big],
	\]
	where $\alpha_{j,0}$ and $\alpha_{j,1}$ are values of $\alpha$ for the edges of $\dg M_\varphi$, which we have not specified because they are rendered irrelevant by the fact that their corresponding cpds are deterministic. We now show how this plays out in the present case.
	Any $\mu \in \Delta\big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]$ we consider has a degenerate marginal on $\mat C$. Specifcally, for every $j$, we have $\mu(C_j) = \delta_1$, and since entropy is non-negative and never increased by conditioning,
	$$
		0 \le \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j) \le \H_\mu(C_j) = 0.
	$$
	Therefore, $\CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ reduces to the negative entropy of $\mu$.
	Finally, making use of the fact that the maximum entropy distribution $\mu^*$ supported on a finite set $S$ is the uniform distribution on $S$, and has $\H(\mu^*) = \log | S |$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma &= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)} \gamma\; \CDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \\
			&= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)} -\, \gamma\, \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \sup\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)}  \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \log (\#_\varphi),
	\end{align*}
	\hspace{1in}giving us
	$$
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right],
	$$
	as desired. We have now reduced \#SAT to computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$, for $\gamma > 0$ and an arbitrary PDG $\dg M$, which is therefore \#P-hard.

    To show the same for $\gamma = 0$, it suffices to add an additional hyperedge pointing to all variables, and associate it with a joint uniform distribution, and confidence 1, resulting in a new PDG $\dg M_\varphi'$.
    Then, because this new edge's contribution to $\OInc_{\dg M}$
    equals $\kldiv{\mu}{\mathsf{Unif}(\X)} = \log |\V\!\X| - \H(\mu)$,
    we have
    \[
        \bbr{\dg M_\varphi'}_0(\mu)
            = \OInc_{\dg M_\varphi'}(\mu)
            = \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) + \log | \V\!\X | - \H(\mu)
            = \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_{1}(\mu) - \log |\V\!\X |.
    \]
    Since this is true for all $\mu$, we conclude that
    \[
        \aar{\dg M_\varphi'} = \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_1 - \log |\V\!\X| = -\log \big( |\V\!\X|\cdot \#_\varphi \big)
    \]
    so the two differ by a constant, and both compute the number of satisfying assignments to $\varphi$. So in general, computing $\aar{\dg M}$ is \#P-hard as well.
\end{lproof}

    \label{sec:inf-via-inc}

\TODO[TODO: rewrite this assuming that the entire main paper is in scope, rather than
    as an alternate introduction to inference of PDGs]

We are now equipped to talk more technically about inference in PDGs.
% When working with traditional graphical models, the meaning is clear.
%k
Since PDG semantics are already given in terms of a scoring function,
% the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it.
the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it.
%joe2*: But what does this minimization have to do with the inference
%problem you defined above?
%oli2*: if you have a concrete joint distribution, computing marginal probabilities of it is trivial, and conditioning is not much harder. Did my additions help?
Such a distribution $\mu$ could straightforwardly be used to answer probabilistic queries \eqref{q:inf} and compute inconsistency.
% There are several immediate difficulties.
There are some immediate difficulties with this approach.
% We immediately run into some obstacles.
% There are some obstacles to this.


\begin{enumerate}[nosep, label=\textbf{D\arabic*.}]
    \item Even writing down a distribution $\mu$, let alone evaluating its score $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma (\mu)$, or minimizing it, takes exponential time.

    \item Generally speaking, optimization is computationally difficult.
        Even our most powerful optimization techniques only provably find optima in certain special cases.
    Unfortunately, while standard optimization techniques seem to work in practice
%joe1: why don't the standard tools apply in our setting?
%oli1: the next sentence explains it: the standard tools require Lipshitz-ness or
% self-concordance. How can I write this more clearly, if I don't really want to go into
% either but still want to mention the names so that people know what doesn't work?
%  (actually, the way the optimizer works is by using a self-concordant barrier function,
%       which is realted, but we can't use self-concordance directly in the obvious way.)
%
%      (more-or-less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      (more or less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      tools do not apply in our setting.
        % and even if it can be
%joe2*: What does it even mean for a pdg to be strictly convex?
%oli2*: The scoring function is convex, in its argument $\mu$. Is this unclear from the wording? [[M]]_\gamma is the scoring function.
%oli2: adding wording to try to abdicate responsibility for motivation
        % Despite being strictly convex,
        To be technical: despite being strictly convex,
        %oli2: removing because I have too many duplicate citations.
        % \parencite[at least for small $\gamma$,][]{pdg-aaai},
        and even $C^\infty$ smooth,
%joe1: I have no idea what self-concordant means.  Unless you're sure
%that over 90% of AIStats folks will now, you must define it and
%explain why it's relevant.  At least I know what the Lipshitz
%condition is, but it couldn't hurt to explain that too.
%joe2*: You still need to explain these terms and MOTIVATE why we care
%about them.
%oli2: I don't really. I want this to be a passing remark for those who know about self-concordance (which I'd guess is 40% of AISTATS folks) and Lipshitz-ness (I'd guess > 95% of AISTATS), but I really don't wan't to make a big deal of either of these two things. They're not important to me, they're just the standard tools that I don't think work. What do you think I should do?
        in general $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ seems to be neither Lipshitz nor self-concordant.
         % convex (in $\mu$, which is exponentially large),
    \item Even if we coulld easily find optimizers of the function $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma > 0$, it's still not obvious that this would allow us to calculate the unique limiting distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*$.
\end{enumerate}

We will ultimately address each of these issues, but before we do so,
% let's start with a shift in perspective.
let's start by trying to do inference as
suggested in the final section of \textcite{pdg-aaai}, which meshes well with
the persepctive taken in \textcite{one-true-loss}.

%joe2*: As I said, this should already be in the intro
%oli2*: As I responded below with %oli1, I disagree because it doesn't pan out;
% it's just an interesting perspective. I think this is the right place for it.
The argument there is that one can do modeling as follows:
    represent all of the relevant information as cpds,
    form a PDG out of them, and
%joe2*: I'm lost.  What knobs do we have?  This comes out of the blue.
%oli2: in this case, just $p(Y|X)$, but I was trying to reerence the general approach
% of my first AISTATS paper, not talk about this in particular. I've done a minor
% tweak to the wording to try to make this clear.
    % play with the knobs you have to to minimize the resulting inconsistency.
    play with whatever knobs are available, so as to minimize the overall inconsistency.
% Well, we have a PDG $\dg M$, and we also have a candidate joint distribution $\mu$.
% What if we put them both on the same footing, in a new PDG, and measure its inconsistency?
%joe1
%It is not hard to show that the distribution any distribution $\mu$
%that minimizes this quantity must also satisfy $\mu \in \bbr{\dg
% It is not hard to show that any distribution
% that minimizes this quantity must be in $\bbr{\dg

What happens if we extend $\dg M$ with a guess, say $p(Y|X)$, and then

since the optimal value of $p(Y|X)$ would be the cpd we wanted.

%task you defined earlier.  A priori, it doesn't look that closely related.

%oli2: smoothness and strict convexity means gradient descent with

% It fits into the story because functions with these properties are relatively easy to

If $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$ are two PDGs, we can take the dusjoint union of their arcs (and associated data) to get a new PDG, denoted $\dg M_1 + \dg M_2$,

\section{WHAT IS INFERENCE? SUBTLETIES FOR PDGS}
% \section{PDG INFERENCE, AND COMPUTING INCONSISTENCY}

What does inference mean in a PDG?
How ought we to respond to a probabilistic query $Q(Y|X{=}x)$?
The answer is not so obvious as it is for other graphical models,
for several different reasons.

\textbf{1.}
% First,
PDGs describe inconsistent beleifs,
so why should we expect to get consistent answers by querying them?
% If the inconsistency were sorted out, then arguably there is no need for a PDG; one may use a probability distribution, or a compressed representation of one (such as a different graphical model) instead.
% Were we able to sort out the inconsistency,
% there is a case to be made that
Even for BNs, we often use algorithms that give inconsistent answers to queries, and BNs very clearly represent a single distribution.
%
% To illustrate one aspect of this,
% A BN may already contain answers to the querie
% Consider a BN in which $X$ is the set of parents of $Y$.
% In this case, our representation already contains the probabilities we are looking for, and we would be happy returning that row of the table.
% Such a BN has a row of a table that represents $\Pr(Y|X{=}x)$, which is the answer we are looking for.
In a BN, we might get lucky and find a row of a cpd that represents $\Pr(Y|X{=}x)$, which would be the answer we're looking for.
% and it would be reasonable to short-circuit an inference procedure upon finding it.
% But in a PDG, that same  $p(Y | X)$ may not even be the only conditional probability on $Y$ given $X$, let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
% But in a PDG, that very same row  $p(Y | X{=}x)$ of the same table may not even be the only  let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
But in a PDG, that same row  $p(Y | X{=}x)$ might not even be the only probability of $Y$ given $X{=}x$, let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.

\textbf{2.}
% \textbf{Conditioning.}
% Secondly,
% Here's a property of PDGs that is not shared by other graphical models:
% Unlike other graphical models,
% Unlike for other graphical models,
% there is a
% PDGs draw a distinction between constraining so that $X{=}x$,
% and  distribution.
In sharp contrast to other graphical models \parencite[pg 26]{koller2009probabilistic},
the PDG formalism draws a distinction between
% computing the distribution of $Y$ under the constraint $X{=}x$,
the posterior distribution of $Y$ after learning that $X{=}x$,
and computing the distribution of $Y$ given $X{=}x$, conditioned in the usual way.

\begin{example}
	Consider a PDG $\dg M$ containing $p(Y)$ with confidence
    $\beta_p = r$, and $q(X|Y)$ with confidence $\beta_q = s$.
	% Now condition on $Y=y$ by adding that event to the PDG, to get
    Now, add the event $X{=}x$ to $\dg M$, to obtain
    % a new PDG:
    a new PDG, $\dg M^{+x}$.
	% \[
	% 	\dg M^{+y} :=
	% 	\begin{tikzpicture}[center base]
	% 		\node[dpad0] (X) at (0,0) {$X$};
	% 		\node[dpad0] (Y) at (1.2,0) {$Y$};
    %         %
	% 		\draw[arr2,->] (X) to
	% 			node[above, pos=0.4,inner sep=2pt]{$q$}
	% 			node[below, pos=0.4, inner sep=2pt]{${\color{gray}\scriptstyle(s)}$}
	% 			(Y);
	% 		\draw[arr2, <-] (X) to
	% 			node[above, pos=0.6,inner sep=2pt]{$p$}
	% 			node[below, pos=0.6, inner sep=2pt]
	% 				{${\color{gray}\scriptstyle(r)}$}
	% 			+(-1.0, 0);
	% 		\draw[arr2, <<-, red] (Y) to
	% 			node[above, inner sep=2pt, pos=0.7]
	% 				{$y$}
	% 			+(0.9,0);
	% 	\end{tikzpicture}.
	% \]
	Now, $\bbr{\dg M}^* = p(Y)q(X|Y)$ doesn't depend on $r$ or $s$, since we can simultaneously satisfy $p$ and $q$---and after conditioning on $X{=}x$, we get a distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^* | X{=}x$ proportional to $p(Y) q(x|Y)$.
	But some calculations reveal that $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^*$,
    while also supported only on worlds where $X{=}x$, is proportional to
	$p(Y) q(x|Y)^{s/r}$.
    % , with an additional exponent $r/s$ that was not present before.
	%
	So if $r = s$,
    % so that the data of $\dg M$ effectively picks out a probability distribution with uniform confidence,
    this amounts to conditioning as usual, but otherwise,
    it doesn't.
    % there is distortion.
    % we don't.
    % Intuitively, the cpd with lower confidence ends
    Intuitively, both the distribution of $Y$ and the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y$ can be bent to satisfy $X{=}x$, and in $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^*$ the cpd with lower confidence will be bent further than the one of higher confidence.
    If $r \gg s$ for example,
    % then the resulting distribution will just be
    then $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^* \approx
    % p(X)\delta_{y}(Y)$.
    p(Y) \delta_x(X)$.
    And perhaps that is even a better answer than conditioning, if indeed we are far more confident in $p$ than in $q$.
\end{example}

So, adding an event to a PDG is a different kind of conditioning,
which is sensitive to confidence.  This has big implications for responding to conditional probability queries, because it means there can be a big difference between restricting to worlds where $Y{=}y$, as is typically done, and conditioning on $Y{=}y$.
Because both notions are defensible,
we start with the uncontroversial, simpler version: solving the marginal inference task.
% So as not to privelidge either notion over the other,
% we define PDG inference to be the marginal task.
% Both notions are defensible, but to put them on the same footing.


% By inference in a PDG, we mean respoding to probabilisty qureies $Q(Y|X)$ for (sets of) variables $X,Y \subset \X$
\begin{defn}
    A \emph{marginal PDG inference algorithm} is a procedure
    that takes as input
    % (1)
    a PDG $\dg M$ over variables $\X$,
    % a non-negative number $\gamma \ge 0$ or $0^+$,
    % either a non-negative number $\gamma \ge 0$ or $\gamma = $``$0^+$'',
    % (2)
    a value for $\gamma \in \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \cup \{0^+\}$,
    and
    % (3)
    % a probabilistic query of the form $Q(Y|X{=}x)$,
    a set of variables $Y \subset \X$,
    % for $X,Y \subset \X$ and $x \in \V X$,
    % returns a probability distribution $\mu(Y)$ that is the conditional marginal
    % and then returns either a distribution $\mu(Y|X{=}x)$
    and then returns either a distribution $\mu(Y)$
    which is the
    % conditional
    marginal
    of some $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$  (if $\gamma$ is a number),
    % or $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X{=}x)$ (if $\gamma = 0^+$).
    or $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y)$ (if $\gamma = 0^+$).
\end{defn}

We can use such marginal inference algorithm
to respond to \emph{conditional} probabilistic queries
% about of $Y$ given $X{=}x$
$Q(Y|X{=}x)$ in both ways.
% in at least two ways:
% one can run
% $\mathit{MInfer}$
On one hand, we can query the marginal distribution of $Y$ in $\dg M + (X{=}x)$
to get this new kind of conditioning;
% $\bbr{\dg M + X{=}x}_\gamma^*(Y) =
% $\mathit{InferMarg}_\gamma(Y | \dg M + (X{=}x) )$.
% That is, first adding the event $X{=}x$ to the PDG.
%
% This procedure can also be used to answer the question in the same way as for other graphical models with minimal overhead.
% Another way
% First, if $X$ is a small set of variables, then we can compute both the marginal $\mu(X,Y)$ and the marginal $\mu(X)$ and compute $\mu(Y|X{=}x)$ directly.
% Alternatively,
% Furthermore,
% On the other hand,
% it will $\mu^*(Y|X{=}x)$
on the other,
each method we present can be augmented with a standard post-procesing step
to compute the usual conditional probability $\mu^*(Y|X{=}x)$.
% can be computed with some post-processing.
% to a conditional probability query amounts to a standard postprocessing step,
% which does not significantly impact the complexity of the algorithm.



\section{LARGER
    \texorpdfstring{$\boldsymbol\gamma$}{GAMMA} AND THE CONVEX-CONCAVE PROCEDURE}
    \label{sec:larger-gamma}

% Now, suppose we're no longer
Next, let's consider the case where $\gamma$ is
larger, meaning that the structural term $(\CDef_{})$,
becomes more important.
Because $\CDef_{}$ can express features of a distribution like conditional indepenedence,
it cannot be convex.%
    \footnote{one can easily verify that set of distributions that make $X$ and $Y$ independent is not convex.}
Nevertheless, \eqref{eq:altscore} still gives us a way to proceed because it is a decomposition into a sum of a convex and a concave function, meaning that we can apply the convex-concave procedure, or CCCP \parencite{yuille2003concave}.
% The first line is the sum of a linear term and a convex one,
In more detail: and each individual term on the second line is either convex or concave, depending on the sign of the quantity $\gamma \alpha\ssub L - \beta\ssub L$.
Once we sort the terms into convex terms $f(\mu)$ and strictly concave terms $g(\mu)$, we can choose an initial guess $\mu_0$, and iteratively use the convex solver as in \cref{sec:small-gamma} to compute
%
\begin{align*}
    \mu_{t+1} &:= \argmin_{\mu} f(\mu) + (\mu - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}
        \nabla g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}

As we will see, the aproach presented here section is
not very fast, but it is guaranteed to make progress, since
\def\tplus1{{t\mskip-2mu+\mskip-2mu1}}
\begin{align*}
    f(\mu_\tplus1) \!+\! g(\mu_\tplus1) &<  f(\mu_\tplus1) \!+\! (\mu_\tplus1 \!-\! \mu_t)^{\sf T} \nabla g(\mu_t) \!+\! g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(concavity of $g$)}
        \\
    &\le  f(\mu_t) + (\mu_t - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}\nabla g(\mu_t)  + g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(defn of argmin)}
    \\
&= f(\mu_t) + g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}
and eventually find an optimum, because the concave terms are bounded (since they are conditional entropies of a finitely supported distribution).
