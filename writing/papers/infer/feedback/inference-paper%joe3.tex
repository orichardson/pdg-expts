\section{INTRODUCTION}

%joe3
%Suppose we have a collection of probabilistic beliefs.
Suppose that we have a collection of probabilistic beliefs. 
%oli1: we answered the first two questions already
% Are they self-consistent? 
How can we tell if they are self-consistent?
How difficult is it to measure how inconsistent they are?
% If not, how far off ar they from being consistent?
How much computation is necessary to synthesize our beliefs into a single joint probability distribution?
This paper provides answers---both
theoretical and practical---to these questions. 
%joe3*: While these are interesting questions, they are not the
%standard questions tyhat have been asked when it comes to inference.
%since no other approach can capture inconsistency well, no one has
%asked the question of how inconsistent beliefs are (to the best of my
%knowledge). Moreover, the notion of inconsistency you're dealing
%with is an idiosyncratic notion, that you tailored to PDGs.   That
%means the leadoff paragraph does not situate this work well in the
%ocntext of what's been done.  It may be better to start with
%inference (what you denote as (Q)) and then move to inconsistency,
%rather than the other way around, as you've done.  I think that would
%make the story read better.


% More concretely, we handle
Probabilistic Dependency Graphs, or PDGs \parencite{pdg-aaai},
are a particularly flexible class of probabilistic graphical models, which subsumes Bayesian Networks (BNs) 
% and Markov Random Fields (MRFs).
and Factor Graphs (FGs). 
%joe1: much too wordy
%The primary force behind the expressiveness of pdgs is their ability
%to capture inconsistent beliefs, and the natural way of measuring the
%degree of this inconsistency that the formalism provides.
PDGs can capture inconsistent beliefs, and have an associated measure
%oli2: I cut "of degree" and added quotes
% of degree of inconsistency that captures how far a PDG is from being consistent.  
of ``inconsistency'' that quantifies how far a PDG is from being consistent.  
% Beyond its role in undergirding the semantics of pdgs,
% Beyond its role in providing the semantics of pdgs, 
% Beyond its central role in the development of PDG semantics, this inconsistency measurement also captures many standard loss functions and statistical divergences \parencite{one-true-loss}.
Beyond its central role in the development of PDG semantics, this measurement of inconsistency has proven to be a natural quantity to minimize.

    loss functions and statistical divergences 
    % used in practice
    % arise as the inconsistency measurement
    can be viewed as measuring the inconsistency
    of a PDG that models the appropriate context.  
Consquently, computing and minimizing it seems eminantly useful.
It follows, for instance, that the training process in machine
learning can largely be conceptualized as inconsistency minimization.

% All of this paints a story of wanting 
%joe1: none of what you said suggests that minimizing inconsistency is
%useful.  Specifically, the fact that Inc can be used to capture a
%number of loss functions and divergences says nothing about why we
%should care about minimizing inconsistency, nor does the fact that 
%the semantics is based on Inc.
% It seems that in a  minimizing inconsistency is a generically useful
 % modeling task.
 %joe1:
 %joe2*: I think here you need to say something about how you can use
 %inconsistency minimization to do inference.  The paper is about
 %inference, after all, and you haven't made the connection.  This is critical
%oli2: I agree, but I'm a little bit furstrated because it was structurally
% much closer to doing this before I accepted your %joe1 edits. 
% I'm rewriting the paragraph.  
% 
% However, the earlier work on PDGs does not provide any
% computational method for calculating whether a PDG is consistent and,
% if not, its degree of inconsistency.  We provide such methods in this paper.
%
%From a pragmatic point of view, though, PDGs are currently not yet
%very useful.  As it stands, they only have conceptual
%applications---one can use them to justify 
%a choice of loss function analytically, or to derive cute diagrammatic proofs
%of inequalitites you likely already know \parencite{one-true-loss},
%but it is impossible to compute with them.
%% What use is a model without an inference algorithm? 
%Until now, PDGs have been a model without an inference algorithm. 

% But how, in general
% However, none of the earlier work provides any 

But how does one \emph{calculate} this degree of inconsistency, in general?

Earlier work does not say.

% Also, how does

% and generalize other graphical models, i
%joe3: this seems unnecessary
%Setting aside for a moment this unique aspect of PDGs,
%it seems they are not even practical as graphical model, because,
%unlike the models that they

%consider?  You need to slow down here and explain what we do
%We analyze the complexity of inference and updating in pdgs, and show

%have to make the connection.

the close relationship it has with inconsistency minimization.
% that it is equivalent to that of inconsistency minimization. 
%joe1*: I have no idea what exponential-cones constraints are.  Unless
%this is a completely standard notion in the AIStats community, you
%*must* give some intuition.  Also, when you talk about reducing the
%problem to a linear program, (a) I don't know which problem you're
%talking about and (b) we usually talk about reducing one problem to
%another, not reducing a problem to a linear program

\section{PRELIMINARIES}

\textbf{Vector notation.}
% This paper concerns the 
% Unless otherwise specified, all scalar quantites range over the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$. 
For us, a vector is a map from a finite set to the extended reals
    $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$. 
The notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ defines a vector over the
finite set $S$.
%joe3: I would still prefer to get rid of superscripts.  They're scary.
We will sometimes use superscripts as well, especially when indices
depend on one another. For example, if $\mathcal X$ is a finite set of
finite sets, then 
%joe2: (1) why is this a disjoint union?  You never said that the sets in
%\X were disjoint.  (2) You don't want to include X \in \X and x
%\n X in the notation; it's really ugly.  I would slightly prefer
%u_{x,X}$.  (3) Technically, if it's a vector, you have to specify the
%order of the elements, and the notation doesn't do that.
%oli2: (1) This is one construction of the disjoint union. It doesn't
%matter if the sets 
% X \in \X are disjoint; even if x is a member of X1 and X2, the indices (X1, x) and (X2,x) will be different.  (2) I agree that it's a little bit ugly, but I think leaving it out is far more confusing.  (3) Not necessarily.  Just because the standard basis (e_1, ... e_n) has an order doesn't mean we have to provide an order if we use a different basis. Sure, we need an order to write down a concrete vector without reference to the basis elements, but we won't need to do that. 
% $\mat u := [u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ defines a vector whose indicies range over the disjiont union $\sqcup \mathcal X$.
%oli2: here's a compromise
% $[u^X_x]_{x \in X, X \in \X}$ denotes a vector which has an element
% for each $X \in \X$ and $x \in X$.
%joe3: I still don't like having both a subscript and a superscript.
%How often do you even use this notation?
%$[u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ denotes a vector which has an element
$[u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ denotes a vector that has an element
%oli2: futher clarifying now that you've stripped the "disjoint union" out...
% for each $X \in \mathcal X$ and $x \in X$.
%joe3
%for each pair $(X,x)$, satisfying $x \in X \in \mathcal X$.
for each pair $(x,X)$ such that $x \in X \in \mathcal X$.
% for each $(X, x)$ 
%joe2: now you're really getting into the weeds.  This is a paper
%about inference, not notation.
%oli2: ok, although I think it's clearer to spell it out.
%It is equivalent to $\mat u := [u_{(x,X)}]_{x \in X, X \in \mathcal X}$, but more compact.
%joe2: I don't know what "the subspace where the upper index is $X$"
%means.  If you really need this notation, you need to explain it
%better.  But this is really the wrong place for it.
%oli2: if you can point out a better place for it later, that's ok.
%joe3: The "better place" is where you first use this notation.  Even
%better would be to get rid of the notation altogether
% But I think this notation will be a distraction once we get into the actual
% story we want to tell.
% Supplying just the upper index, $\mat u^{X}$ is the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace where the upper index is $X$. 
% Supplying just the upper index, $\mat u^{X_0} := [u^{X_0}_x]_{x \in {X_0}}$
% is the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace whose upper index is $X_0$. 
By supplying just the upper index of such a vector, as in $\mat u^{X_0}$,
we mean $[u^{X_0}_x]_{x \in {X_0}}$, the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace whose upper index is $X_0$. 
Vectors over the same set can be added (+) and partially ordered
($\le$) pointwise as usual; pointwise multiplication is denoted by
$\odot$.   
$\mat 1$ denotes an all-ones vector, whose dimension will always be clear in context.
$\mat u^{\sf T}$ denotes the transpose of $\mat u$, which we use
%joe3
%primarily to denote the inner product $\mat u^{\sf T} \mat v$.
primarily to define an inner product $\mat u^{\sf T} \mat v$. 
% If $\mat u : A \to \Rext$ is a vetor over $A$, and $\mat v : A \times B \to \Rext$,
% then $\mat u \otimes \mat 1 : A \times \Gamma \to \Rext$, by 
% $(\mat u \otimes \mat 1)(a,\gamma) := \mat u(\gamma)$
If $\mat u = [u_a]_{a \in A}$ is a vector over $A$ and $\mat v = [v_b]_{b \in B}$ is a vector over $B$, then $\mat u \mathbin{\otimes} \mat v := [ u_a \cdot v_b ]_{a \in A, b \in B}$ is a vector over $A \times B$.

\textbf{Probabilities.}
We write $\Delta S$ to denote the set of probability distributions over a finite set $S$.
Every variable $X$ can take on a finite set $\V(X)$ of possible values. 
% If $S$ is a finite set, we write $\Delta S$ for the set of probability distributions over $S$, i.e., the simplex over its elements. 
A conditional probability distribution (cpd) $p(Y|X)$ is a map 
%joe2
%$p : \V(X) \to \Delta \V(Y)$, so it assigns, to every $x \in \V(X)$, a
$p : \V(X) \to \Delta \V(Y)$, so it assigns to each $x \in \V(X)$ a
probability distribution $p(Y|x) \in \Delta Y$, which is shorthand for $p(Y|X\!\!=\!x)$.
Given a joint distribution $\mu$ over many variables including both $X$ and $Y$, 
%joe1: Is this standard notation for a marginal?  \mu)(X) looks like
%the probability of X to me.
%oli1: I'm pretty sure it's standard; at the very least, it agrees
%with the standard notation:  If you had Pr(X,Y), and you wanted to
%talk about the probability of X, you would write Pr(X), which is also
%the marginal of the distribution \Pr.
%joe3: I would never write \Pr(X) (and would also never write \Pr(X,Y)
%to denote the joint distribution; I find this horrible notation),
%confounding the argument to a probability with the description of
%something like the domain of the probability)
we write $\mu(X)$ for its marginal distribution on $X$, 
% $\mu(X,Y)$ for the 
and $\mu(Y|X)$ for the cpd obtained by first conditioning on $X$ and then marginalizing to $Y$. 
We measure information in a distribution with entropy $\H(\mu) := \Ex_{\mu} [\log \frac1\mu]$ and conditional entropy $\H_\mu(Y|X) := \Ex_\mu[\log\frac1{\mu(Y|X)}]$, where $X$ and $Y$ are variables.

\textbf{Graphs.}
%joe2: what's the INTUITION for a hyperedge?  
%oli2: I don't get why this is necessary. At this point it's just an
%analogue of a 
% graph. Would you want me to give intuition for what an edge of a
% graph means in  
% general, if it were slightly less standard?  It's useful generally. 
%joe3: For people not familiar with hypergraphs, perhaps an example of
%why we want hyperedges would be very helpful.  Having a good
%intuition helps people think about things.  People are familiar with
%graphs and edges, so no need to give intuition for it.  But I

The semantics of a PDG are given by two scoring functions over joint distributions $\mu(\N)$ over all variables.
The \emph{incompatibility} of $\mu$ with a PDG $\dg M$, which
measures the discrepancy between $\mu$ and the cpds of $\dg M$,
is given by the weighted sum of relative entropies:
\begin{align*}
    \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) :=
        % \sum_{L \in \Ed} \beta\ssub L\, \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(\Tgt L,\Src L)}{p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L) \mu(\Src L)}.

%since what you later call qualitative also involves quantities (so
%isn't the least bit qualitative)
%joe3: I would prefer not to give this complicated discussion, which
%we never make use of.
%Using a standard interpretation of the relative entropy
%$\kldiv{\mu}{p} := \Ex_{\mu}[\log \frac\mu p]$, we may view $\Inc_{\dg

%cpds of $\dg M$ (weighted by the confidence we have in them),
%supposing that the world is in fact distributed according to $\mu$.
We can think of the relative entropy $\kldiv$ as measuring, for each
hyperedge $a$, the ``distance'' from the cpd associated with $a$ to the
corresponding marginal probability determined by $\mu$ (weighted by
our confidence in $a$).

  %\item
  %joe3: this is not intuition for why we want to do this (especially

%        This quantitative limit is what is used to generate nearly
%        all of the loss functions in \textcite{one-true-loss}, which
%        are largely empirical in nature. 
%joe3: I have no idea of what you mean by a calibrated model.  
\item 
        Optimizing inconsistency in this limit guarantees a calibrated model, which is one of the biggest advantages PDGs have over factor graphs
         \parencite[Example 5]{pdg-aaai}.
        
    \item 
%oli2: ok, I'm sure this is overkill on intuition, so I commented it
      %out.
      %joe3: You didn't coment it out, so I did.  This is not
      %intuition for why we want to take the limit as \gamma goes to 0.
%    When $\balpha = \mat 0$, this is the principle of maximum entropy;
%    for other values of $\balpha$ it is a causally sensitive variant
%    which accounts for the fact that cpd constraints themselves carry
%    different amounts of entropy depending on the settings of the
%    variables.  
%joe3: this doesn't explain why we want to take \gamma to 0 either
%    \item 
%    Another reason to focus on the quantitative limit is pragmatic:
%    there is a unique optimal joint distribution, $\bbr{\dg M}^*$ (at
%    least if $\bbeta > \mat 0$). 
%    In any case, this is the way in which PDGs define a unique joint
%    distribution, and hence may be thought of as a graphial model. 
\end{enumerate}
% This distribution uniquely achieves the smallest information deficiency among those distributions maximally compatible with $\dg M$. 

One should be careful to distinguish this joint distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^* \in \Delta\V \N$, which arises in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$, from $\bbr{\dg M}^*_0$, the set of distributions that minimize 
%joe1
%$\Inc_{\dg M}$ which contains $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, and possibly many others.
$\Inc_{\dg M}$; the latter set can be shown to contain $\bbr{\dg
  M}^*$ (see \cite{pdg-aaai}), but may also contain other distributions.

%joe2: There is not a unique "inconsistency" of a PDG.  Again, you're
%giving a family of inconsistencies, indexed by \gamma.  So, at best,
%you can talk about the inconsistency relative to \gamma (which you
%must MOTIVATE). 
The inconsistency of a PDG $\dg M$ is the smallest possible score of any distribution:
\begin{align*}
    \aar{\dg M}_\gamma := \inf_{\mu \in \Delta\!\V\!\N}\, \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu).
\end{align*}
To parallel the notation for scoring functions, when we omit the subscript, we refer to the limit as $\gamma\to 0$, which, unlike before, obeys $\aar{\dg M} = \aar{\dg M}_0$.

\section{INFERENCE VIA INCONSISTENCY MINIMIZATION}
    \label{sec:inf-via-inc}

We are now equipped to talk more technically about inference in PDGs. 
% When working with traditional graphical models, the meaning is clear. 
%k
Since PDG semantics are already given in terms of a scoring function,
% the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it. 
the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it.
%joe2*: But what does this minimization have to do with the inference
%problem you defined above?
%oli2*: if you have a concrete joint distribution, computing marginal
%probabilities of it is trivial, and conditioning is not much
%harder. Did my additions help?
%joe3*: What additions are you talking about?  I don't see anywhere
%where you've connected minimization with inference.  How could such a
%distribution \muy be used to answer queries?  Why does it give the
%"right" answer?  Is it the right answer bhy definition?  That is, is
%it the case that, by definition, are you looking for \mu(Y) for the
%\mu that is M^*?  If so, you need to say that somewhere.
Such a distribution $\mu$ could straightforwardly be used to answer probabilistic queries \eqref{q:inf} and compute inconsistency.  
% There are several immediate difficulties.
There are some immediate difficulties with this approach.
% We immediately run into some obstacles.
% There are some obstacles to this.


\begin{enumerate}[nosep, label=\textbf{D\arabic*.}]
    \item Even writing down a distribution $\mu$, let alone evaluating its score $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma (\mu)$, or minimizing it, takes exponential time.
    
    \item Generally speaking, optimization is computationally difficult.
%joe3
%      Even our most powerful optimization techniques only provably
      Even our most powerful optimization techniques are only
      guaranteed to
      find optima in certain special cases. 
    Unfortunately, while standard optimization techniques seem to work in practice
%joe1: why don't the standard tools apply in our setting?
%oli1: the next sentence explains it: the standard tools require Lipshitz-ness or
% self-concordance. How can I write this more clearly, if I don't really want to go into
% either but still want to mention the names so that people know what doesn't work? 
%  (actually, the way the optimizer works is by using a self-concordant barrier function,
%       which is realted, but we can't use self-concordance directly in the obvious way.)
%
%      (more-or-less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      (more or less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      tools do not apply in our setting.
        % and even if it can be 
%joe2*: What does it even mean for a pdg to be strictly convex?  
%oli2*: The scoring function is convex, in its argument $\mu$. Is this unclear from the wording? [[M]]_\gamma is the scoring function. 
%oli2: adding wording to try to abdicate responsibility for motivation
        % Despite being strictly convex,
        To be technical: despite being strictly convex,
        %oli2: removing because I have too many duplicate citations.
        % \parencite[at least for small $\gamma$,][]{pdg-aaai},
        and even $C^\infty$ smooth, 
%joe1: I have no idea what self-concordant means.  Unless you're sure
%that over 90% of AIStats folks will now, you must define it and
%explain why it's relevant.  At least I know what the Lipshitz
%condition is, but it couldn't hurt to explain that too.
%joe2*: You still need to explain these terms and MOTIVATE why we care
%about them.
%oli2: I don't really. I want this to be a passing remark for those who know about self-concordance (which I'd guess is 40% of AISTATS folks) and Lipshitz-ness (I'd guess > 95% of AISTATS), but I really don't wan't to make a big deal of either of these two things. They're not important to me, they're just the standard tools that I don't think work. What do you think I should do?
        in general $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ seems to be neither Lipshitz nor self-concordant.
         % convex (in $\mu$, which is exponentially large),
    \item Even if we coulld easily find optimizers of the function $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma > 0$, it's still not obvious that this would allow us to calculate the unique limiting distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*$.
\end{enumerate}

We will ultimately address each of these issues, but before we do so, 
% let's start with a shift in perspective.
let's start by trying to do inference as
suggested in the final section of \textcite{pdg-aaai}, which meshes well with 
the persepctive taken in \textcite{one-true-loss}. 

%joe2*: As I said, this should already be in the intro
%oli2*: As I responded below with %oli1, I disagree because it doesn't pan out;
% it's just an interesting perspective. I think this is the right place for it. 
The argument there is that one can do modeling as follows:
    represent all of the relevant information as cpds, 
    form a PDG out of them, and 
%joe2*: I'm lost.  What knobs do we have?  This comes out of the blue.
%oli2: in this case, just $p(Y|X)$, but I was trying to reerence the
%general approach 
% of my first AISTATS paper, not talk about this in particular. I've done a minor
% tweak to the wording to try to make this clear.
    % play with the knobs you have to to minimize the resulting inconsistency.
%joe3*: My comment 
    play with whatever knobs are available, so as to minimize the overall inconsistency.
% Well, we have a PDG $\dg M$, and we also have a candidate joint distribution $\mu$.
% What if we put them both on the same footing, in a new PDG, and measure its inconsistency?
%joe1
%It is not hard to show that the distribution any distribution $\mu$
%that minimizes this quantity must also satisfy $\mu \in \bbr{\dg
% It is not hard to show that any distribution 
% that minimizes this quantity must be in $\bbr{\dg
  % M}_\gamma^*$. More generally,  
Well, we have a PDG $\dg M$, and we wanted to know the probablility of $Y$ given $X$. 
What happens if we extend $\dg M$ with a guess, say $p(Y|X)$, and then
%oli2: added, to address your concern below
alter $p$ so as to minimize inconsistency? 
As hinted in \textcite{pdg-aaai},
this
%oli2: modified
% would indeed perform our inference task,
would indeed suffice for inference,
%oli2: also added
since the optimal value of $p(Y|X)$ would be the cpd we wanted.
 
%joe2*: What does this proposition have to  say about the inference
%task you defined earlier.  A priori, it doesn't look that closely related.
%oli2: did my additions above help?

% 
% In the limit of small $\gamma$, since there is only one such distribution,

% 
% \begin{linked}{coro}{smallgammaopt}
%joe1: What's a "quantiative limit"? 
%oli1: it's the limit as \gamma -> 0;

% to remember the worlds, because the symbols are sufficient to get the meaning.
%joe3: I still see no reason why this is a "quantitative limit", and I

%into the PDG"    
%oli1: good point--- I'm not just adding ("includig") the new probability, but
% also measuring its inconsistency.
% which measures the inconsistency of 
\end{linked}

%joe1*: The claim that we can use inconsistency to compute the
%marginal probability of somne (small) set of variables is an
%important part of the story of why inconsistency is important, and
%should have come *much* earlier (i.e., in the introduction)
%
%oli1: If this was what gave the reason we don't discuss it in the introduction
Consequently, if we are interested only in querying the marginal probability of some small subset $Y$ of variables conditioned on other ones $X$ (i.e., the usual form of a query to a graphical model), and we had an efficient way to estimate the inconsistency of a guess $p(Y|X)$ with the rest of the model, we would have successfully cleared obstacle \textbf{D1}.

% Since inference in other graphical models is already NP-hard, 
% and the class of PDGs subsumes capture them, it should be no surprise 
% that inference in PDGs is NP hard as well.

Since inference in other graphical models is already NP-hard,

Still, one might imagine that \emph{resolving} the inconsistency is the hard part,
    as opposed to noticing it. 
Might it easier to simply determine whether or not a PDG is inconsistent?
% If this seems reasonable, you might suspect that this reformulation could increase the difficulty of optimization (\textbf{D2})---that we might lose the several nice properties we do have (strict convexity and smoothness)---but this concern turns out not to be substantiated. 
%
%joe2: we don't need to try to get into the reader's head
%oli2: the problem is that it doesn't (clearly) increase the difficulty of the optimization, so "this could increase" is wrong. I only mean to suggest that one might suspect that. 
If this were the case, one might imagine that the reformulation

%joe2*: Again, why do we care about this result?  How does it fit into

%oli2: smoothness and strict convexity means gradient descent with 
% an infinitely small step size is guaranteed to find the unique optimum distribution. 
% It fits into the story because functions with these properties are relatively easy to
% optimize. At the outset, we know inference is hard. We can ask ourselves: is it the

% the latter.  How can I make this come through?

Note that the marginals $\mu(\Src a, \Tgt a)$ and $\mu(\Src a)$ are

Logic similar to that in \cref{sec:illust} yields:

This is a start, but what we were really after was the unique distribution
$\bbr{\dg M}^*$ that also minimizes $\IDef{\dg M}$.

\subsection{Incorporating IDef}
    \label{sec:also-idef}
% To do this second pass, we will need this second property
% As $\gamma \to 0$, the limit of $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$
So far, we have only found \emph{some} distribution that minimizes $\Inc$; 
we really wanted to find the unique distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*$.
It turns out that a solution to \eqref{prob:joint-inc} can be used to construct a second optimization problem of a similar size, that also optimizes $\IDef{}$ subject to these constraints, finally addressing \textbf{D3}. 
% To justify our approach, we will to prove two more results.

First, a characterization of the set $\bbr{\dg M}^*_0$ of distributions that are maximally compatible with $\dg M$. 

\begin{prop}\label{prop:marginonly}
    For a PDG $\dg M$ with arcs $\cal A$,
	the highest-compatibility distributions (the minimizers $\bbr{\dg M}_0^*$ of $\Inc_{\dg M}$) all have the same conditional probabilities along the edges of $\dg M$.   
	That is, if there is an arc $\ed aXY \in \Ar$, and $\mu_1, \mu_2 \in \bbr{\dg M}_0^*$,
%joe2: You haven't defined "quantitatively optimal"
%oli2: refactored.
    % are quantitatively optimal distributions,
    % (i.e., both $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ minimize $\Inc_{\dg M}$),
    then $\mu_1(Y|X) = \mu_2(Y|X)$.  
    % then $\mu_1(Y|X)\mu_2(X) = \mu_2(Y|X) \mu_1(X)$.  
\end{prop}

As a result, having already found one minimizer of $\Inc_{\dg M}$ via \eqref{prob:joint-inc}, it suffices to constrain distributions that have the same conditional marginals along the edges, and now optimize $\IDef{}$.%
    \footnote{
        Technically, to deal with the possibility that variables we
%joe2
%        are conditioning on might have probability zero,
        are conditioning on have probability zero,  
        we require that $\mu(X,Y)\nu(X) = \mu(X) \nu(X,Y)$, rather than 
        $\mu(Y|X) = \nu(Y|X)$.
    }

We now run into a second issue: IDef is not convex in $\mu$. 
Fortunately, when we constrain to distributions that optimize $\Inc$, 
% it equals another function that is.

Moreover, this function can also be represented with exponential cones.

%
% One nice feature of $\Inc$, which was integral to 
In the construction of \eqref{prob:cluster-inc}
and proof of \cref{prop:cluster-idef}, we rely
heavily on the fact that 
each term 
of $\Inc_{\dg M}$
depends only on local conditional marginal distributions $\mu_{C_a}(\Tgt a | \Src a)$,
which can easily be computed from the clique tree $\bmu$.
However, the same cannot be said of $\IDef{}$, because it depends on the joint entropy $\H(\Pr_{\bmu})$ of the entire distribution.
% Now, there is still hope because teh
Because $\Pr_{\bmu}$ has the Markov property with respect to
the tree decomposition $\mathcal T$, 
% Because the clusters form a tree with respect to which $\bmu$ has the Markov property,
the joint entropy may computed exactly in terms of the cluster marginals \parencite{wainwright2008graphical}, by

Nevertheless, there are some subtleties applying this in our setting.
In particular, it may not be obvious that the negation of \eqref{eq:bethe-entropy} can be 
captured with exponential cone constraints in which every argument is affine.

Now each cluster $C \in \cal C$, except for $C_0$, has a parent cluster $\Par_C$;
define $\Par_{C_0} := \emptyset$ to be an empty cluster, since $C_0$ has no parent. 
Finally, for each $C \in \mathcal C$, let $\Pash_C := C \cap \Par_C$ denote the
the set of variables that the cluster $C$ has in common with its parent cluster.
% Now, we can compute the Bethe Entropy,
Because $\cal T$ is a tree, we can decompose the entropy of $\Pr_{\bmu}$ as 
%
\begin{align*}
    \H(\Pr_{\bmu}) &= 
        \H(\mu_{C_0}) + 
        % \sum_{(C, D) \in \mathcal T}
        \sum_{(C \to D) \in \mathcal T}
        \H_{\Pr_{\bmu}}(D \mid C)\\
    &= \sum_{C \in \cal C} 
        \sum_{c \in \V(C)} \mu_C(c) \log \frac
            {\mu_C(c)}{\mu_C( \Pash_C(c) )}
\end{align*}
%
% This means that
Note that the denominator $\mu_C(\Pash_C)$ is an affine transformation of $\mu_C$.
The upshot is that we have written the joint entropy in a way that 
splits as a sum of terms over the clusters, each of which can be captured as a dcp exponential cone constraint. 

Suppose that $\boldsymbol\nu = \{\nu_C : C \in \mathcal C\}$ is a calibrated clique tree over the tree-decomposition $(\mathcal C, \mathcal T)$ representing a distribution $\Pr_{\boldsymbol\nu} \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_0$, say obtained by solving \eqref{prob:cluster-inc}.

For $C \in \mathcal C$, let $\Ar_C:= \{ a \in \Ar : C_a = C\}$ be the set of 
edges assigned to cluster $C$, and let

Once again, let $\mat u := [ u^C_c ]^{C \in \mathcal C}_{c \in \V(C)}$,
and consider the following optimization problem.

\subsection{A Polynomial Time Algorithm For PDGs of Bounded Tree-Width}

\cref{prop:cluster+idef} shows that finding distributions that optimize the PDG scoring function \eqref{eqn:scoring-fn} can be written as a convex optimization problem with a
polynomial number of variables and constraints and with an objective that is also polynomial-sized.
All that remains to achieve polynomial-time inference is to show that a problem of this form can be solved in polynomial time. For this, we turn to interior point methods, which are known \parencite{badenbroek2021algorithm} to converge in polynomial time.
Specifically, \eqref{prob:cluster+idef} can be transformed via established methods \parencite{agrawal2018rewriting} into a standard form called an \emph{exponential conic program} which itself can be solved in polynomial time by commercial solvers \parencite{mosek}.

There is an algorithm that takes $O(n^4 \log n  \log \nf1\epsilon )$ time,
and finds a point $\epsilon$-close in residual norm to the optimal distribution

\begin{coro}
    PDG inference can be solved to machine precision in $O( N^4 V^4 \log(N V) \exp(V T) )$ time, where $T$ is the tree-width of the graph, and $N$ is the total number of variables, $V$ is the number of values per variable, and $T$ is the tree-width of the PDG's underlying hypergraph.

\section{INFERENCE WHEN
    \texorpdfstring{$\boldsymbol\gamma \boldsymbol> \mat 0$}{gamma > 0},
    VIA THE CONVEX-CONCAVE PROCEDURE }

We have now given an algorithm that provably finds the distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*$ in polynomial time. 
What about optimal distributions for fixed $\gamma > 0$.



To do this, we re-use our work in \cref{sec:reductions} employ the convex-concave procedure 
\parencite{yuille2003concave} to find some minimizer $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$ (although it may not be unique), for fixed $\gamma > 0$.

The PDG scoring function can be written as \parencite[Proposition 4.6]{pdg-aaai}
\begin{align*}
    \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) = 
        -\gamma\H(\mu) + 
            \sum_{L \in \Ed}
                % \left[
                \beta\ssub L\, \Ex_\mu 
                    \log \frac1{p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L)}
                % \right]
                \\
            + \sum_{L \in \Ed}
            (\gamma \alpha \ssub L - \beta\ssub L)
                \Ex_\mu \log \mu(\Tgt L | \Src L)
\end{align*}
The first line is the sum of a linear term and a convex one,
and each individual term on the second line is either convex or
concave, depending on the sign of the quantity $\gamma \alpha\ssub L -
\beta\ssub L$.  
Once we sort the terms into convex terms $f(\mu)$ and concave terms $g(\mu)$, we can choose an initial guess $\mu_0$, and iteratively use the convex solver to compute
%
\begin{align*}
    \mu_{t+1} &:= \argmin_{\mu} f(\mu) + (\mu - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}
        \nabla g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}

As we will see in \cref{sec:expts}, the aproach presented here section is 
not very fast, but it is guaranteed to make progress, since
\begin{align*}
    f(\mu_{t+1}) + g(\mu_{t+1}) &\le  f(\mu_{t+1}) + (\mu_{t+1}-\mu_t)^{\sf T} \nabla g(\mu_t) + g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(concavity of $g$)}
        \\
    &\le  f(\mu_t) + (\mu_t - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}\nabla g(\mu_t)  + g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(defn of argmin)}
        \\
    &= f(\mu_t) + g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}
and eventually find an optimum, because the concave terms are bounded.
%
% The slightly trickier part is combining this with the clique tree representation of \cref{sec:clique-tree-expcone}.
% \TODO[ TODO: Show the fancier spanning aborescence trick ]
%
% To combine this tech this with the clique tree representation of 
The only remaining difficulty is to do the convex optimization over
calibrated clique-trees. Fortunately, we already dealt with the 
tricky part (rewriting the joint entropy term as a disciplined convex program) in 
\cref{sec:clique-tree-expcone},
and so we defer the details to the appendix.
    
\section{OTHER APPROACHES TO PDG INFERENCE} \label{sec:other-inference}

\subsection{}
A stronger result than \cref{prop:markov-property} holds as well.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:same-set-dists}
    % For all $\gamma > 0$ and in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$, 
    Let $\Ed$ be a set of (hyper)edges over $\N$. 
    For every PDG $\dg M$ over $\N$ with edges $\Ed$, every $\gamma > 0$, and every optimum $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ of $\dg M$'s scoring function at $\gamma$, 
    there is a factor graph $\Phi$ with factors along $\Ed$ such that $\Pr_\Phi = \mu^*$. 
\end{prop}

In other words: every distribution that a PDG can pick out as optimal (for any choice of $\gamma > 0$ and also in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$), can also be described as a factor graph with the same structure as that PDG.
How do we square this with the \citeauthor{pdg-aaai}'s claim that PDGs are more general than factor graphs?

% This may be surprising, given how \citeauthor{pdg-aaai} position their model as strictly more expressive than other graphical models, because it implies that the optimal distribution 
\TODO[TODO: answer this question.\\
    The short answer: PDGs still compose differently, and in a way that respects the meaning of the probabilities. And just because you can find a factor graph that would have given you the right distribution after the fact, doesn't mean you could have specified the component factors.]
% The answer is simply that 


\TODO[Also: don't get lost; figure out how to continue as below:]
\cref{prop:same-set-dists} suggests another approach to avoiding an exponential representation of $\mu$: given a PDG, fit a factor graph that has the same structure to it. 

\subsection{Approximate Inference}
% \subsubsection{Relaxing the Marginal Polytope}
\textbf{Relaxing the marginal polytope.}
Just as it is possible to do belief propogation on cluster graphs that are not trees (e.g., loopy belief propogation)
so too is it possible to drop the requirement that the cluster that we use is indeed a tree-decomposition.
This program is smaller, and will converge, but it will only be an approximate solution. 
Like the original PDG itself, it might be inconsistent.

\subsection{Comparison To Belief Propogation}

Since PDGs generalize other graphical models, one might wonder how our method stacks up against them. 
We benchmarked against the small networks, and some of the medium-sized ones, from the \href{https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/}{\texttt{bnlearn}} repository. 



\subsection{Evaluations On Random PDGSs}
We start by focusing on empirical properties of the optimization over joint distributions.

We generated several hundred PDGs with various properties: 9 or 10 variables, each of which can take 2-3 values. Each PDG contains 7-15 hyperedges, with 1-2 target nodes and 0-3 source nodes. The cpds are chosen by taking uniformly random numbers from [0,1] and normalizing appropriately, and every $\beta$ is set to 1.
For each PDG $\dg M$, we measure its complexity by:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \texttt{n\_edges}, the number of edges in $\dg M$,
    \item \texttt{n\_params}, the total number of parameters across all the cpds of $\dg M$, and
    \item \texttt{n\_worlds}, the size of the joint distributions on the variables of $\dg M$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Capacity.} 
The black-box py-torch based approaches clearly have an edge in that they can handle larger models; see the cut-offs on the right sides of \cref{fig:resources,fig:gap-resource-fine}.

\textbf{Resource Costs.} 
Look at \cref{fig:resources}. 
Note that the exponential cone methods without the CCCP (blue and green) are actually faster than LBFGS, which was the best-performing torch optimizer. 
However, they use \emph{significantly} more memory, and cannot handle more than 8000 worlds. 


\textbf{Accuracy.}
In addition to being faster, the exponential cone techniques are also more preicse.
Note that the CCCP is typically more precise than the black-box
optimizers when the problem is fully convex $\gamma \le 1$, and
mirrors the performance of the exp-cone algorithms for the
%joe3
%quantitative limit on the left, in blue.  For combinations of larger
limit on the left, in blue.  For combinations of larger
$\gamma$ and more worlds however, the 20 iteration maximum we imposed
is not nearly enough to get convergence, and the black-box optimizers
are both faster and attain better objective values. 

\section{DISCUSSION}

% Our anaysis 
Our analysis shows that inference in PDGs with bounded tree-width can be done .


\TODO[ the below is a transplant without context; fix it ]
% Some queries are more difficult than others. 
Although we the question the same way, we also want to point out that there are other reasonable ways to answer that question once we move to PDGs.
Suppose we were looking at a BN in which it just so happens that $\mat X$ contains only a single variable and $\mat Y$ are the parents of $\mat X$.
In this case, our representation already contains the probabilities we are looking for, and we would be happy returning that row of the conditional probability table. 
But in a PDG, that cpd $p(\mat Y \,|\,\mat X)$, even if it is the only one
attached to an edge from $X$ to $Y$, may not be the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
As a consequence,

	% }
	We start by expanding the definitions, obtaining
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma &= \inf_\mu ~\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma(\mu) \\
			&= \inf_\mu \left[ \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu)
				+ \Ex_{x\sim\mu_{\!_X}} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(Y\mid x)}{p(Y\mid x)} \right]\\
			&= \inf_\mu \left[ \bbr{\dg M }_\gamma(\mu)
				+  \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(X,Y)}{p(Y \mid X)\, \mu(X)} \right].
	\end{align*}
	% % Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.
	% Since $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ is a $\gamma$-strongly convex function of $\mu$ for all

	% $\kldiv{\mu_{XY}}{\mu_X \; p_{Y\mid X}}$ is 1-strongly

	% $, which equals $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$,
	% is $\gamma$-strongly convex in $p$.

	% % Smoothness.


	% Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.
	Fix $\gamma < \min_L \beta_L$. Then we know that $\bbr{\dg X}_\gamma(\mu)$ is a $\gamma$-strongly convex function for every PDG $\dg X$, and hence there is a unique joint distribution which minimizes it.

	\textbf{Strict Convexity.}
	Suppose $p_1(Y \mid X)$ and $p_2(Y\mid X)$ are two cpds on $Y$ given $X$.
	Fix $\lambda \in [0,1]$, and set $p_\lambda = (1-\lambda) p_1 + \lambda p_2$.
	Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ and $\mu_\lambda$ be the joint distributions that minimze $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_1}_\gamma$, $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_2}_\gamma$ and $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma$, respectively.  Then we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma
			= \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(X,Y)}{p_\lambda(Y\mid X) \mu_\lambda( X)}.
	\end{equation*}
	By convexity of $\bbr{\dg M}$ and $\thickD$, we have
	\begin{align}
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda)
		 	&\le (\lambda-1)\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1) + \lambda \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	\label{eqn:score-cvx}\\
		\text{and}\qquad \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)}
			&\le (1-\lambda)\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \nonumber \\
			&\qquad+ \lambda\;\;\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}.
				\label{eqn:D-cvx}
	\end{align}
	If $\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ then since $\bbr{\dg M}$ is strictly convex, \eqref{eqn:score-cvx} must
	be a strict inequality. On the other hand, if $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, then since $\mu_\lambda = \mu_1 = \mu_2$ and $\thickD$ is stricly convex in its second argument when its first argument is fixed (\Cref{lem:Dstrongcvx}), \eqref{eqn:D-cvx} must be a strict inequality.
	In either case, the sum of the two inequalities must be strict, giving us
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma &=
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)} \\
		&<
		 (\lambda-1) \left[\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \right]
			 \\[-0.3em]&\qquad\qquad
			 + \lambda \left[ \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}
			 	\right] \\
		 &= (\lambda-1) \aar{\dg M \bundle p_1} + \lambda\,\aar{\dg M \bundle p_2},
	\end{align*}
	which shows that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}$ is \emph{strictly} convex in $p$, as desired.


	\textbf{Smoothness.}
	If $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*$ is a positive distribution, then by definition $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}$ achieves its minimum on the interior of the probability simplex $\Delta \V(\dg M \bundle p)$, and so by \Cref{lem:cvx4}, we immediately find that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$ is smooth in $p$.

	Now, suppose that $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*(\mat w) = 0$,  for some $\mat w \in \V(\dg M \bundle p)$.

	Applying \Cref{lem:cvx4} to the function $f = \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$

	Now for the second case.

	If $x^*_b \in \partial X$, then we claim that either

	If $f$ is strictly convex in $X$, and for some $y_0 \in Y$, $f(x, y_0)$ achieves its infemum on the interior of $X$.
	then $y\mapsto \inf_x f(x, y)$ is smooth $(C^\infty)$ at the point $y_0$.

\begin{lproof}%[Proof of \Cref{lem:cvx4}]
	% Let $f_y(x) = f(x,y)$.
	% Since $f$ is smooth and stritly convex, each restriction $f_y$ of $f$ to a
	% particular $y$ is also smooth and strictly convex.
	% As a result, each $f_y$ has a unique minimum $m_y := \inf_{x} f_y(x)$.
	% As $f_y$ is smooth, $m_y$ is either a boundary point, or
	% at a point where $\nabla f_y = 0$.
	%
	% Moreover, it is a constrained optimization problem, so
	% $\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} [ f(x,y) + \lambda (y_0 - y)] = 0$.
	%
	% \TODO
	Let $x_0^* := \arg\min_x f(x,y_0)$, which is achieved by assumption, and is unique because $f(-,y_0)$ is strictly convex.

	We will ultimately apply the implicit function theorem to give us a smooth function which is equal to this infemum, but to do so we must deal with the technicality that it requires an open set; the boundary is the most complicated part of this result.
	Here we have essentially required that the domain be open by fiat for $X$, but for $Y$ (which is a possibly non-open subset of $\mathbb R^m$), we use the Extension Lemma for smooth functions \cite[Lemma 2.26]{Lee.SmoothManifolds}. In our context, it states that
	for every open set $U$ with $\overline{Y} \subseteq U \subseteq \mathbb R^m$,
	there exists a function $\tilde f : X \times \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb R$, such that $\tilde f |_{Y} = f$ (and $\supp \tilde f \subseteq U$).
	We only need a small fraction of this power: that we can smoothly extend $f$ to \emph{some} open set of $\mathbb R^m$, which we fix and call $\tilde Y$.

	% Similarly, for other $y \in Y$, let $x^*_y$ be the unique value of $x$ which minimizes $f(x,y)$.

	% \textbf{Smoothness.}
	% By assumption, $x^*_b$ is not a boundary point of $X$.
	%
	We claim that now all conditions for the Implicit Function Theorem are met if invoked with
		$\phi(y,x) := \vec\nabla_x \tilde f(x,y)$ and $(\mat b,\mat a) = (y_0, x^*_0)$.
	Concretely, we have $m = \mathop{dim} X$, $n = \mathop{dim} Y$, and $Z = (\tilde Y \times X)^\circ$, i.e., the interior of $\tilde Y \times X$, which is open and contains $(\mat b, \mat a)$.
	 Becuase $\phi$ is smooth, it is $k$-times differentiable for all $k$. We have $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f (y_0, x^*_0) = \vec 0$ because $x^*_0$ is a local minimum of the smooth function $\tilde f(-, y_0)$ which lies on the interior of $X$.

	Moreover, the Jacobian matrix
	\[ \mat J_{\nabla\!\tilde f, x}(y_0, x_0^*) = \left[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x^*_0, y_0) \right]\]
	is the Hessian of the strictly convex funtion $f(-, b)$, and therefore positive definite (and in particular non-singular).
	Therefore, the Implicit Function Theorem guarantees us the existence of a neighborhood $U \subset \tilde Y$ of $y_0$ for which
	there is a unique $k$-times differentiable function $g: U \to X$ such that $g(y_0) = x^*_0$ and $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f(y, g(y)) = 0$ for all $y \in U$. Of course, this implies $g(y) = \argmin_x f(x,y)$ at every such point, and $\inf_x f(x,y) = f(g(y),y)$ is a composition of the smooth function $f$ with the $k$-times differentiable function $g \otimes \mathrm{id}_Y$.
	Therefore, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is itself $k$-times continuously differentiable at $y_0$ for all $k$, or in other words, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is smooth at $y=y_0$.

\subsection{Hardness Results}

\recall{prop:consistent-NP-hard}
\begin{lproof} \label{proof:consistent-NP-hard}
	We can directly encode SAT problems as PDGs.
	Specifically, let
	$$\varphi := \bigwedge_{j \in \mathcal J} \bigvee_{i \in \mathcal I(j)} (X_{j,i})$$
	be a CNF formula over binary variables $\mat X := \bigcup_{j,i} X_{j,i}$. Let
	$\dg M_\varphi$ be the PDG containing every variable $X \in \mat X$ and a binary
	variable $C_j$ (taking the value 0 or 1) for each clause $j \in \mathcal J$, as well as the following edges, for each $j \in \mathcal J$:
	%\{$``$\varphi(\mat X)$''$\}$ with $\V(\varphi) = \{0,1\}$, and
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a hyperedge $\{X_{j,i} : i \in \mathcal I(j)\} \tto C_j$, together with a degenerate cpd
			encoding the boolean OR function (i.e., the truth of $C_j$ given $\{X_{j,i}\}$);
		\item an edge $\pdgunit \tto C_j$, together with a cpd asserting $C_j$ be equal to 1.
	\end{itemize}
	% We give each edge $\alpha = 0$ and $\beta = 1$.
	First, note that the number of nodes, edges, and non-zero entries in the cpds are polynomial in the $|\mathcal J|, |\mat X|$, and the total number of parameters in a simple matrix representation of the cpds is also polynomial if $\mathcal I$ is bounded (e.g., if $\varphi$ is a 3-CNF formula).
	A satisfying assignment $\mat x \models \varphi$ of the variables $\mat X$ can be regarded as a degenerate joint distribution $\delta_{\mat X = \mat x}$ on $\mat X$, and extends uniquely to a full joint distribution $\mu_{\mat x} \in \Delta \V(\dg M_\varphi)$ consistent with all of the edges, by
	\[ \mu_{\mat x} = \delta_{\mat x} \otimes \delta_{\{C_j = \vee_i  x_{j,i}\}} \]

 	Conversely, if $\mu$ is a joint distribution consistent with the edges above, then any point $\mat x$ in the support of $\mu(\mat X)$ must be a satisfying assignment, since the two classes of edges respectively ensure that $1 =\mu(C_j\!=\! 1 \mid \mat X \!=\! \mat x) = \bigvee_{i \in \mathcal I(j)} \mat x_{j,i}$ for all $j \in \mathcal J$, and so $\mat x \models \varphi$.

	Thus, $\SD{\dg M_\varphi} \ne \emptyset$ if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable, so
	an algorithm for determining if a PDG is consistent can also be adapted (in polynomial space and time) for use as a SAT solver, and so the problem of determining if a PDG consistent is NP-hard.

	\textbf{PART (b).}
    We prove this by reduction to \#SAT. Again, let $\varphi$ be some CNF formula over $\mat X$, and construct
	$\dg M_\varphi$ as in \hyperref[proof:consistent-NP-hard]{the proof} of
	\Cref{prop:consistent-NP-hard}.
	Furthemore, let $\bbr{\varphi} := \{ \mat x : \mat x \models \varphi \}$ be the set of  assingments to $\mat X$ satisfying $\varphi$, and $\#_\varphi := |\bbr{\dg M}|$ denote the number such assignments. We now claim that
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:number-of-solns}
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right].
	\end{equation}
 	If true, we would have a reduced the \#P-hard problem of computing $\#_\varphi$ to the problem of computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma$. We now proceed with proof \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns}.
	By definition, we have
	\[ \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = \inf_\mu \Big[ \Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) + \gamma \IDef{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \Big]. \]
	We start with a claim about first term.
	% For the particular PDG $\dg M_\varphi$, the

	\begin{iclaim} \label{claim:separate-inc-varphi}
		% $\Inc(\dg M_\varphi)$ is finite if and only if $\varphi$ is statisfiable.
		$\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) =
		% \begin{cases}
		% 	0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
		% 	 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
		% 	\infty & \text{otherwise}
		% \end{cases}
		\begin{cases}
			0 & \text{if}~  \supp \mu \subseteq \bbr{\varphi} \times \{ \mat 1\} \\
			\infty & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}$.
	\end{iclaim}
	\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{lproof}
		Writing out the definition explicitly, the first can be written as
		\begin{equation}
			\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = \sum_{j} \left[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j)}{\delta_1} +
				\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_{j,i}}} \right], \label{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}
				% &= \sum_{j} \left[
				% 	\begin{matrix} \mu(C_j\!=\!0) (\infty) \\
				% 	 	+ \mu(C_j \!=\! 1) \log \mu(C_j \!=\! 1)
				% 	\end{matrix} +
				% 	\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_i}} \right],
		\end{equation}
		where $\mat X_j = \{X_{ij} : j \in \mathcal I(j)\}$ is the set of variables that
		appear in clause $j$, and $\delta_{(-)}$ is the probability distribution placing all mass on the point indicated by its subscript.
		As a reminder, the relative entropy is given by
		\[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\nu(\Omega)} := \Ex_{\omega \sim \mu} \log \frac{\mu(\omega)}{\nu(\omega)},
		\quad\parbox{1.4in}{\centering and in particular, \\ if $\Omega$ is binary,}\quad
			\kldiv[\big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\delta_\omega} = \begin{cases}
				0 &  \text{if}~\mu(\omega) = 1 ; \\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}.
		\end{cases} \]
		Applying this to \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}, we find that either:
		\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
			\item Every term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is finite (and zero) so $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$, which happens when $\mu(C_j = 1) = 1$ and $\mu(C_j = \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) = 1$ for all $j$.  In this case, $\mat c = \mat 1 = \{ \vee_i~x_{j,i} \}_j$ so $\mat x \models \varphi$ for every $(\mat{c,x}) \in \supp \mu$;
			\item Some term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is infinite, so that $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = \infty$, which happens if some $j$, either

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\mu(C_j \ne 1) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,c}) \in \supp \mu$ with $\mat c \ne 1$, or
				\item $\supp \mu(\mat C) = \{\mat 1\}$, but $\mu(C_j \ne \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,1}) \in \supp \mu$ for which $1 = c_j \ne \vee_i~x_{j,i}\;$, and so $\mat x \not\models \varphi$.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		Condensing and rearranging slightly, we have shown that
		\[
			\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
			\begin{cases}
				0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
				 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases}~.
		\]
		% So if $\mat x \models \varphi$ for all $\mat x \in \supp \mu(X)$,
		%
		% $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$
		% The first term is infinite if $\mu(C_j = 1) < 1$, and the second is infinite
		% if $\mu(C_j = \lor_i X_{i,j}) < 1$. Thus, if $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then $\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X)$ satisfies $\varphi$ with probability 1, and $\varphi$ must be satisfiable.
		% Conversely,
	\end{lproof}

	% Thus, if $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then every $\mat x \in \supp \mu$ is a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$.
	Because $\IDef{}$ is bounded, it follows immediately that
 	$\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, is finite if and only if
	there is some distribution $\mu \in \Delta\V(\mat X,\mat C)$ for which $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, or equivalently, by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, iff there exists some $\mu(\mat X) \in \Delta \V(\mat X)$ for which $\supp \mu(\mat X) \subseteq \bbr{\varphi}$, which in turn is true if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable.

	In particular, if $\varphi$ is not satisfiable (i.e., $\#_\varphi = 0$), then $\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = +\infty$, and
	\[
		\exp \left[ -\frac1\gamma \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma \right] =
	 		\exp [ - \infty ] = 0 = \#_\varphi,
	\]
	so in this case \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns} holds as promised. On the other hand, if $\varphi$ \emph{is} satisfiable, then, again by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, every $\mu$ minimizing $\bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, (i.e., every $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma^*$) must be supported entirely on $\bbr{\varphi}$ and have $\Inc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = 0$.  As a result, we have
	\[
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma =
			\inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]} \gamma\; \IDef{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) .
	\]
	A priori, by the definition of $\IDef{\dg M_\varphi}$, we have
	\[
		\IDef{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
		 	- \H(\mu) + \sum_{j} \Big[ \alpha_{j,1} \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j)
						+ \alpha_{j,0} \H_\mu(C_j) \Big],
	\]
	where $\alpha_{j,0}$ and $\alpha_{j,1}$ are values of $\alpha$ for the edges of $\dg M_\varphi$, which we have not specified because they are rendered irrelevant by the fact that their corresponding cpds are deterministic. We now show how this plays out in the present case.
	Any $\mu \in \Delta\big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]$ we consider has a degenerate marginal on $\mat C$. Specifcally, for every $j$, we have $\mu(C_j) = \delta_1$, and since entropy is non-negative and never increased by conditioning,
	$$
		0 \le \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j) \le \H_\mu(C_j) = 0.
	$$
	Therefore, $\IDef{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ reduces to the negative entropy of $\mu$.
	Finally, making use of the fact that the maximum entropy distribution $\mu^*$ supported on a finite set $S$ is the uniform distribution on $S$, and has $\H(\mu^*) = \log | S |$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma &= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]} \gamma\; \IDef{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \\
			&= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]} -\, \gamma\, \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \sup\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]}  \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \log (\#_\varphi),
	\end{align*}
	\hspace{1in}giving us
	$$
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right],
	$$
	as desired. We have now reduced \#SAT to computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$, for $\gamma \in \mathbb R^{>0}$ and an arbitrary PDG $\dg M$, which is therefore \#P-hard.
\end{lproof}
