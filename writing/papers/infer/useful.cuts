\begin{conj}
    Inference in a PDG---that is, computing conditional marginals of $\bbr{\dg M}^*$---%
    and the computing inconsistency $\aar{\dg M}$ are equally difficult:
        there are polynomial-time reductions from each to the other.
\end{conj}

If we do not restrict to finite variables, then the problem is much worse.

\begin{linked}{conj}{incomputable}
    The problem of deciding whether a PDG whose variables take values in $\mathbb N$ is not computable.
