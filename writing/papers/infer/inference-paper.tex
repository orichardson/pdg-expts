%%-----------    A FRANK SUMMARY    ---------------

Measuring / Estimating /  Inconsistency is very useful.
For instance, (1) propogating it backwards through layers of computation = differentiable learning. 

Certain localized versions of it can be used to do other algorithms.



How hard is it? 







With interior point methods (convex programs with exponential cone constraints) we can do it in $O(n^4 \log n)$ time \& space, worst case for exact inference. So far, this means slightly harder than inference in Graphical models.
