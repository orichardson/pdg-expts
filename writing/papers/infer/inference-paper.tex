% Measuring / Estimating /  Inconsistency is very useful.

% Certain localized versions of it can be used to do other algorithms.

% How hard is it?
% With interior point methods (convex programs with exponential cone constraints) we can do it in $O(n^4 \log n)$ time \& space, worst case for exact inference. So far, this means slightly harder than inference in Graphical models.

\section{Introduction}


% {\color{gray}
% Suppose that we have a collection of probabilistic beliefs.
% How can we tell if they are self-consistent?
% How difficult is it to measure how inconsistent they are?
% How much computation is necessary to synthesize our beliefs into a single joint probability distribution?
% This paper provides answers---both
% theoretical and practical---to these questions. }
%joe3*: While these are interesting questions, they are not the
%standard questions tyhat have been asked when it comes to inference.
%since no other approach can capture inconsistency well, no one has
%asked the question of how inconsistent beliefs are (to the best of my
%knowledge). Moreover, the notion of inconsistency you're dealing
%with is an idiosyncratic notion, that you tailored to PDGs.   That
%means the leadoff paragraph does not situate this work well in the
%ocntext of what's been done.  It may be better to start with
%inference (what you denote as (Q)) and then move to inconsistency,
%rather than the other way around, as you've done.  I think that would
%make the story read better.

%joe1: much too wordy

%joe4
%Unlike the models they generalize,
% PDGs can capture inconsistent beliefs, and have an associated measure
%joe4: a PDG doesn't "have probabilities", and I don't know what it
%means for a PDG to be being self-consistent.
%oli4: I don't get this comment. Obviously it has probabilities. A PDG is a collection of (conditional) probabilites (that aren't all over the same variable, or conditioned on the same events). That is, the most general container for probabilistic information.
%oli4: your rewrite (below) isn't talking about the same thign I am. What you're talking about is what we call ``incompatibility'', not inconsistency. The inconsistency is the more important notion.
%| of inconsistency that quantifies how far a probability measure is from
%| satisfying the constraints of the PDG.
%oli4: ^ I also don't like calling the conditional probabilities "constraints", for a couple of reasons: (1) as a modeling tool, I want people to just articulate all of the probailistic beliefs they have on hand, and the term "constraint" suggests particular flavor or strength of belief; (2) we expect that typicallly all of the constraints will be violated.
%oli4: How is this for a compromise, that doesn't include "self-consistency"?
%joe5: A PDG doesn't "contain" belief
%oli5: what? it does; it's litterally a container for conditional probability distributions which are interpreted as beliefs. I don't understand your objection to this at all
%A PDG can contain inconsistent beliefs, and there is a natural way
%measuring its degree of inconsistency. 
%joe5: I don't find it so natural.
%oli5: Is there anything I can do to convince you that it is?  It has very special properties, and I find it very well-motivated.  The various alternatives I've played with do not work nearly as well, and are much hrader to motivate.  The AISTATS paper shows that this choice gives the standard modeling objective in a huge variety of situations.  I feel like that alone is enough to claim that it's natural. 
%joe5: Moreover, we're not measuring the degree of inconsistency of a PDG; we're measuring how inconsistent PDG is with a particular proability distribution.
%oli5: !!! That's not what I'm talking about. You're filling in what you think I'm trying to say again, instead of reading what I wrote. You've made this edit every time we've gone back and forth, and I keep explaining what I mean and changing it back. What I want to say is simpler and better ties it into my AISTATS paper. I think bringing a  joint distribution into this here is totally unnecessary and complicates things.

%oli5: (retracted edits; see below) adopting Joe's version, but it requires some tweaks, for two reasons:
% Small problem: one of these things is "incompatibility" not inconsistency, and the sentence structure doesn't work so well if you call the concepts different things. 
% Bigger problem: the ability to measure the incompatibility of a distribution with a PDG is independent of the ability to represent inconsistent beliefs.  Factor graphs, consistent PDGs, and even probability distributions themselves, all have measurements of how incompatible they are with probability distributions.

\expandafter\discard\vjoe{
%joe5*: The issue isn't correctness but how we define inferfence
%joe5*: I rewrote this pareagraph completely.  We need to tell the "right"
%  story, and tell it early.  
    Before discussing our algorithm, we must discuss what it even means to do inference for a PDG.  BNs and factor graphs represent a unique distribution. 
    Thus, for example, when we ask ``What is the probability of $Y$ given $X$''
    % Thus, when we query the probability of $Y$ given $X$
    in a Bayesian network $B$, we mean ``what is $\mu(Y \mid X)$?'' for the probability $\mu$ represented by $B$.
    But a PDG does not, in general, represent a unique probability distribution.

    Like BNs, PDGs encode two types of information: ``structural''
    information about the independence of causal mechanisms,
    and ``observational'' information,
    Corresponding to these two types of information,
    a PDG has two loss functions,
    which associate with a
    probability distribution $\mu$
    how far $\mu$ is from capturing each of
    these two types of information.
    %
    Given a weight $\gamma \in [0,\infty)$,
    we take the \emph{$\gamma$-semantics} of a PDG to be the
    set of distributions that minimize the observational loss function
    plus $\gamma$ times the structural loss function plus.
    We can also consider the \emph{$*$-semantics}, which, roughly speaking,
    is the limit of $ \gamma$-semantics as $\gamma$ goes to 0 (so amounts to focusing on
    the observational loss, using the structural loss only to break
    ties).  This gives us a family of inference notions, parameterized
    by $\gamma$ (or $*$), depending on how we choose to weight the loss
    function. 
    %
    It can be shown that, given a PDG $\dg M$, if there are distributions
    consistent with both observational and the structural information in
    ${\dg M}$, then all these inference notions coincide; that is, 
    {%%% !!!! %%%
        there is a
        single distribution $\mu_{\dg M}$ that minimizes both loss functions, so
        no matter how we weight the loss functions, we want to answer
        queries with respect  to $\mu_{\dg M}$.
    }
    Moreover, if $\dg M$ represents a BN,
    then $\mu_M$ is the distribution represented by the BN.  
    However, if there is no
    distribution that is consistent with both types of information, then
    the choice of $\gamma$ matters.  
    Thus, we talk about $\gamma$-inference or $*$-inference.}


Before discussing our algorithm, we must discuss what it even means to do inference for a PDG.  
A BN or FG represents a unique distribution. 
Thus, for example, when we ask ``what is the probability of $Y$ given that $X{=}x$?''
% Thus, when we query the probability of $Y$ given $X$
\def\BNPr{\mu}
% \def\BNPr{\Pr}

% So, in that case, this  sentence amounts to saying "if all observations are uniform, 
% then we're talking about a uniform distribution", which is quite a bit weaker than
% the original text might have us think.
%oli5*: also there is a technical issue, even if we are willing to 
% use "consistent with structural information" in this very strict sense:
% namely, it requires that  \beta >> \alpha (or the stronger assumption \beta > 0). 
% Otherwise, there may not be a unique distribution.

Moreover, if $\dg M$ represents a BN,

% "More broadly, each of these algorithms can be described from two perspectives: as a procedural description of a message passing algorithm, or as an optimization problem consisting of an objective and a constraint space. Historically, the message passing algorithm generally originated first, sometimes long before the optimization interpretation was understood. However, the optimization perspective provides a much deeper understanding of these methods, and it shows that message passing is only one way of performing the optimization; it also helps point the way toward useful generalizations.""

% Unless otherwise specified, all scalar quantites range over the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% For us, a vector is a map from a finite set to the extended reals
%     $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
%joe4: I have never heard this terminology.  Since vectors are not
%functions, it seems to me very strange to talk about the domain of a
%vector.  Unless this is completely standard, please do not use this
%terminology.  in the sentence below, S is definitely *not* the domain
%of the vector.  People do not think of vectors as functions.  Why
%intrdocue nonstandard terminology that is (in my opinion) largely
%unnecessary.  It's a distraction for the reader.  I tried to tone it down.
%oli4: I'll concede that "domain" might be confusing in this context. 
% But the term "shape" is actually incredibly standard in machine learning. Not only  is this true in ML papers, but every numpy array, and every torch or tensorflow tensor %has a "shape" field. 
%joe5: If it's standard to use the "shape" in this context, just as
%I've used structure, then it's OK to use shape.  But only if "shape"
%is used exactly in this way.
%oli5: I have seen exactly this definition before for vectors with named dimensions, although for full disclosure: usually people only use the index sets [n] = {1,...n}. So for instance, an m by n matrix is very standardly called a tensor of shape (m, n), which here is written of shape [m] x [n].  So this lines up exactly with the standard notion of shape.  (It also lines up exactly with a notion of "shape" from category theory. )
%oli4: your rewrite is a little more verbose less precise, and doesn't say what values the compnoents can take. I've it out, but I'll try to do the toning down myself.

%  We typically denote a vector $\mat u$ whose indices range over a set $S$ using

For us, a vector is a map from some finite set $S$, called its

\emph{shape},
to the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% The \emph{shape} of a vector $\mat u$ is the finite set which is its domain.

\discard{\color{gray!30!white}
    We will sometimes use superscripts as well, especially when indices depend on one another. For example, if $\dg S$ is a finite set of finite sets, then
    %joe2: (1) why is this a disjoint union?  You never said that the sets in
    %\X were disjoint.  (2) You don't want to include X \in \X and x
    %\n X in the notation; it's really ugly.  I would slightly prefer
    %u_{x,X}$.  (3) Technically, if it's a vector, you have to specify the
    %order of the elements, and the notation doesn't do that.
    %oli2: (1) This is one construction of the disjoint union. It doesn't matter if the sets % X \in \X are disjoint; even if x is a member of X1 and X2, the indices (X1, x) and (X2,x) will be different.  (2) I agree that it's a little bit ugly, but I think leaving it out is far more confusing.  (3) Not necessarily.  Just because the standard basis (e_1, ... e_n) has an order doesn't mean we have to provide an order if we use a different basis. Sure, we need an order to write down a concrete vector without reference to the basis elements, but we won't need to do that.
    % $\mat u := [u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ defines a vector whose indicies range over the disjiont union $\sqcup \mathcal X$.
    %oli2: here's a compromise
    % $[u^X_x]_{x \in X, X \in \X}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    % for each $X \in \X$ and $x \in X$.
    $[u^S_s]^{S \in \dg S}_{s \in S}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    for each pair $(S,s)$, satisfying $s \in S \in \dg S$.
    By supplying just the upper index of such a vector, as in $\mat u^{S_0}$,
    we mean $[u^{S_0}_s]_{s \in {S_0}}$, the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace whose upper index is $S_0$.

%oli5: I still don't see the problem --- this just means the set of variables \X is closed under union.
%oli5: in any case, this fix won't quite address the problem, because we also need to marginalize to sets of variables, for example.  Maybe this is more acceptable if I word it so it sounds more temporary, like this?:

%oli1: I'm pretty sure it's standard; at the very least, it agrees with the standard notation:  If you had Pr(X,Y), and you wanted to talk about the probability of X, you would write Pr(X), which is also the marginal of the distribution \Pr.
%joe4*: But who write \mu(X,Y) to denote a distribution on X and Y?
%That seems equally nonstandard (and is *horrible* notation), because

%oli4*: I must be understanding what you think is nonstanard.  People write P(X,Y), q(X,Y), or \mu(X,Y) to denote a joint distribution on X and Y all the time.  It's what Koller & Friedman do, it's Pearl's notation, and it's also standard in ML.  
% I also don't understand the difficulty in distinguishing the probability of X=x from a probability on X.  If X is a variable, then \mu(X=x), is the probability that X=x, and \mu(X) is the marginal on X. 
we write $\mu(X)$ for its marginal distribution on $X$,

A hypergraph $G = (V, \Ed)$ is a set $V$ of vertices, and a collection $\Ed$ of \emph{hyperedges}, which correspond to subsets of $V$.

    A \emph{directed hypergraph} $G = (N, \mathcal A)$ is a set $N$ of nodes, and a collection $\mathcal A$ of \emph{(hyper)arcs}; each $a \in \mathcal A$

In turn, a directed hypergraph can be seen as a hypergraph
by taking the union of the source and target sets,
thereby ``forgetting the direction of the arrow''.

The \emph{width} of a tree decomposition is one less than the size of its largest cluster,

%oli4*: I had the same instinct a while back. That is the notation we had in our first

% to discrete variables, that is technically a reasonable thing to do here. 
% but also the indices are more complicated than you suggested with your rewrite. I think

% of technical ambiguities we need to be careful of --- like, what is \mu(X) p(Y|X)? 
% Because of that, I'm reverting to my original notation.
%joe5*: I'm sorry;  I don't get it.  You write \mathcal P, and never
  %explain what it is.  You write p_a, which is your notation for
  %a component of a vector p, but never explain what p is, and how it
  %differs from \mathcal P.  (If it does, then I'm completely
  %mystified as to how.)  
%oli5: The notation for a vector is if I first were to define
% {\bf p} = [p_a]_{a \in \Ar} --- but instead I just defined components p_a for 
% a \in \Ar, without making a vector out of them. Surely it's OK to use subscripts for
% something else?  In fact, using \mathcal P over {\bf p} is precisely to distinguish
% this from being a vector. 
%joe5*: I don't understand your concerns above,

'*-semantics' doesn't  quite do it justice; it's not at all descriptive, and we may as well just write [[M]]* at that point.

%joe5*: I cut this.  I see no reason that it should be our main

%*-inference, and also talk about \gamma-inference. 
%oli5*: it's still one of our two main goals. Mathematically, it's the 
% more difficult and interesting of the two, and arguably it's more useful, since it applies more broadly. As a practical matter, I still think we should end the paragraph by explaining that this is also a goal, even if we don't say it's a "main" goal. Also, this is the right place to define *-inference. 
%joe5: No need to introduce yet another bit of new terminlogy 
% (which woudl conflict with \gamme-inference in any case).
%oli5: on the contrary, your notion of *-inference is new terminology, while \epsilon-inference does not conflict at all with \gamma-inference; as I wrote before, it's \gamma-inference for an infinitessimal \epsilon.

One of our main goals is to answer probabilistic queries with respect to $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, which we call \emph{$\epsilon$-inference},

%oli5: Without the sentence above, we still need a sentence to tie this up; the paragraph is supposed to define $0^+$ inference.
This paper also shows how to efficiently answer queries with respect to $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, which we call \emph{$0^+$-inference}.

%joe4*: I cut this paragraph frmo here.  This notation should be

%oli4: The secondary thread of our story is that we can compute << M >>, the inconsistency.  I think this is a sufficiently important concept that it demands definition here; proposition 1 seems like an inappropriate place to make this definition to me, because one might skip over proposition 1, and really this is core background material about PDGs. 
% As for being a loss function, I'll grant that, we've already said as  much about why we care about it, but I thought it would be good to follow up on this now that we can talk about it more formally.

But the constraints that these methods can handle are insufficient for

Operationally, we need to know the conditional marginals of $\bmu$ along each edge in order to calculate $\OInc_{\dg M}(\Pr_{\bmu})$.

that the source and target of every arc $a$ lie entirely within at least one cluster.

% which can easily be computed from the clique tree $\bmu$.
%joe4: How can a distribution be an affine transformation of a clique tree?
%oli4: we have formally identified the clique tree with its vector representaiton [\mu_{C,c}]_{c \in C \in \C}. What I mean is that this distribution (as a vector) is an affine transformation of the clique tree (as a vector). Since we're talking about that optimization problem in this capacity, I don't think there's any ambiguity. 
%joe5: how about giving the poor reader a hint.  She can't read your mind!
%oli5: ok, how about this: 
% which are affine transformations of the clique tree $\bmu$.
More precisely, we rely on the fact that those marginal distributions, regarded as points on the appropriate simplex, are affine transformations of the analogous vector representation $[\mu_{C}(c) ]_{C \in \C}$ of the clique tree $\bmu$.
% However, the same cannot be said of $\SDef_{}$, because it depends on the joint entropy $\H(\Pr_{\bmu})$ of the entire distribution.
It is not so clear that $\SDef_{}$ can be dealt with in the same way, because it depends on the joint entropy $\H(\Pr_{\bmu})$ of the entire distribution.
% Now, there is still hope because teh

% We should point out an important reason to restrict to clique trees, generally speaking:
At this point we should point out an important information-theoretic reason to restrict our focus to trees:
% Because $\Pr_{\bmu}$ has the Markov property with respect to the tree decomposition $\mathcal T$,
% Because the clusters form a tree with respect to which $\bmu$ has the Markov property,
it allows the joint entropy to be expressed

Choose a root node $C_0$ of the tree decomposition $\mathcal T$, and orient each edge of $\mathcal T$ so that it points away from $C_0$.
Now each cluster $C \in \cal C$, except for $C_0$, has a parent cluster $\Par_C$;
define $\Par_{C_0} := \emptyset$ to be an empty cluster, since $C_0$ has no parent.
Finally, for each $C \in \C$, let $\Pash_C := C \mathbin{\cap} \Par_C$ denote the
the set of $\mathbf v$ariables that cluster $C$ has in $\mathbf c$ommon with its $\mathbf p$arent cluster.

For this, we turn to interior point methods.
%joe5*: Again, what are they converging to?  What does "converge" mean
%in this context.
%oli5: interior point methods such as these produce a sequence of points to try to f  follow a trajectory known as the the "central path", and for us what's relevant is that this sequence of points converges to the limiting endpoint of that path in polynomial time. These are Chris's words, but I think the last bit can be safely removed.

% Finally, we can do clique tree calibration as usual

Empirically, one interesting feature of PDG inference is that, even in practice, applying black-box optimization methods such as gradient descent and LBFGS, do not reliably find minima of \eqref{eqn:scoring-fn}.

\subsection{Comparison To Belief propagation}

Since PDGs generalize other graphical models, one might wonder how our method stacks up against them.
We benchmarked against the small networks, and some of the medium-sized ones, from the \href{https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/}{\texttt{bnlearn}} repository.



\subsection{Evaluations On Random PDGSs}
We start by focusing on empirical properties of the optimization over joint distributions.

We generated several hundred PDGs with various properties: 9 or 10 variables, each of which can take 2-3 values. Each PDG contains 7-15 hyperedges, with 1-2 target nodes and 0-3 source nodes. The cpds are chosen by taking uniformly random numbers from [0,1] and normalizing appropriately, and every $\beta$ is set to 1.
For each PDG $\dg M$, we measure its complexity by:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \texttt{n\_edges}, the number of edges in $\dg M$,
    \item \texttt{n\_params}, the total number of parameters across all the cpds of $\dg M$, and
    \item \texttt{n\_worlds}, the size of the joint distributions on the variables of $\dg M$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Capacity.}
The black-box py-torch based approaches clearly have an edge in that they can handle larger models; see the cut-offs on the right sides of \cref{fig:resources,fig:gap-resource-fine}.

\textbf{Resource Costs.}
Look at \cref{fig:resources}.
Note that the exponential cone methods without the CCCP (blue and green) are actually faster than LBFGS, which was the best-performing torch optimizer.
However, they use \emph{significantly} more memory, and cannot handle more than 8000 worlds.


\textbf{Accuracy.}
In addition to being faster, the exponential cone techniques are also more precise.
Note that the CCCP is typically more precise than the black-box optimizers when the problem is fully convex $\gamma \le 1$, and mirrors the performance of the exp-cone algorithms for the quantitative limit on the left, in blue.  For combinations of larger $\gamma$ and more worlds however, the 20 iteration maximum we imposed is not nearly enough to get convergence, and the black-box optimizers are both faster and attain better objective values.

%sentences in the conlusion that discusses these results.
\section{OTHER APPROACHES TO PDG INFERENCE} \label{sec:other-inference}
% \section{EXTENSIONS}

\subsection{}
A stronger result than \cref{prop:markov-property} holds as well.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:same-set-dists}
    % For all $\gamma > 0$ and in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$,
    Let $\Ed$ be a set of (hyper)edges over $\X$.
    For every PDG $\dg M$ over $\X$ with edges $\Ed$, every $\gamma > 0$, and every optimum $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ of $\dg M$'s scoring function at $\gamma$,
    there is a factor graph $\Phi$ with factors along $\Ed$ such that $\Pr_\Phi = \mu^*$.
\end{prop}

In other words: every distribution that a PDG can pick out as optimal (for any choice of $\gamma > 0$ and also in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$), can also be described as a factor graph with the same structure as that PDG.
How do we square this with the \citeauthor{pdg-aaai}'s claim that PDGs are more general than factor graphs?

% This may be surprising, given how \citeauthor{pdg-aaai} position their model as strictly more expressive than other graphical models, because it implies that the optimal distribution
\TODO[TODO: answer this question.\\
    The short answer: PDGs still compose differently, and in a way that respects the meaning of the probabilities. And just because you can find a factor graph that would have given you the right distribution after the fact, doesn't mean you could have specified the component factors.]
% The answer is simply that


\TODO[Also: don't get lost; figure out how to continue as below:]
\cref{prop:same-set-dists} suggests another approach to avoiding an exponential representation of $\mu$: given a PDG, fit a factor graph that has the same structure to it.

\subsection{Approximate Inference}
% \subsubsection{Relaxing the Marginal Polytope}
\textbf{Relaxing the marginal polytope.}
Just as it is possible to do belief propagation on cluster graphs that are not trees (e.g., loopy belief propagation)
so too is it possible to drop the requirement that the cluster that we use is indeed a tree decomposition.
This program is smaller, and will converge, but it will only be an approximate solution.
Like the original PDG itself, it might be inconsistent.

\subsubsection{Variational Approaches}

% Because of the deep connection between variational approaches
% shown in \parencite{one-true-loss}, there's





\section{DISCUSSION}

% Our anaysis
Our analysis shows that inference in PDGs with bounded tree-width can be done .


% \TODO[ the below is a transplant without context; fix it ]
% % Some queries are more difficult than others.
% Although we the question the same way, we also want to point out that there are other reasonable ways to answer that question once we move to PDGs.
% Suppose we were looking at a BN in which it just so happens that $\mat X$ contains only a single variable and $\mat Y$ are the parents of $\mat X$.
% In this case, our representation already contains the probabilities we are looking for, and we would be happy returning that row of the conditional probability table.
% But in a PDG, that cpd $p(\mat Y \,|\,\mat X)$, even if it is the only one
% attached to an edge from $X$ to $Y$, may not be the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
% As a consequence,


There are still a number of open questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if $\bbeta < \gamma \balpha$?

\section{Proofs}
%oli5*: next seven pages are new. 


\recall{prop:warmup-correctness}
\begin{lproof}
    \label{proof:warmup-correctness}
    Suppose that $(\mu, \mat u)$ is a solution to \eqref{prob:joint-inc}.
    The exponential cone constraints ensure that, for every $(a, s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$, 
    $$
        u_{a,s,t} \ge \mu(s,t) \log \frac{\mu(s,t)}{\p_a(t|s)\mu(s)}
    $$
    where $\mu(s,t)$ and $\mu(s)$, as usual, are shorthand for $\mu(\Src a{=}s, \Tgt a{=}t)$ and $\mu(\Src a {=} s)$, respectively.
    
    Suppose, for contradiction, that one of these inequalities is strict at some an index $(a',s',t') \in \V\!\Ar$ for which $\beta_{a'} > 0$.
    Explicitly, this means
    $$
        u_{a',s',t'} > \mu(s_0,t_0) \log \frac{\mu(s',t')}{\p_{a'}(t'|s')\mu(s')}.
    $$
    In that case, we can define a vector $\mat u' = [u'_{a,s,t}]_{(a,s,t)\in\V\!\Ar}$ which is identical to $\mat u$, except that at $(a',s',t')$, it is halfway between the two quantities described as different above.  More precisely:
    $$
        u'_{a',s',t'} = \frac12 u_{a',s',t'} + \frac12 \log \mu(s',t') \log \frac{\mu(s',t')}{\p_a(t'|s')\mu(s')}.
    $$
    Note that $u'_{a',s',t'} < u_{a',s',t'}$,
    and also that, by construction, $(\mu, \mat u')$ also satisfies the constraints of \eqref{prob:joint-inc}.
    In more detail: for $(a', s', t')$ it doesn't violate the associated exponential cone constraint, as
    $$
        \left( \text{formally:} \quad
        u'_{a',s',t'} = \frac12 u_{a',s',t'} + \frac12 \log \mu(s',t')\log \frac{\mu(s',t')}{\p_{a'}(t'|s')\mu(s')}
        > 
        % \frac12 \mu(s_0,t_0) \log \frac{\mu(s,t)}{\p_a(t|s)\mu(s)} + \frac12 \mu(s_0,t_0) \log \frac{\mu(s,t)}{\p_a(t|s)\mu(s)}
        % =
        \mu(s',t') \log \frac{\mu(s',t')}{\p_{a'}(t'|s')\mu(s')}
        \right),
    $$
    and $\mat u'$ remains unchanged at the other indices, and so satisfies the constraints there becasuse $\mat u$ does. 
    But now, because $u'_{a', s', t'} < u_{a',s',t'}$, and $\beta_{a'} >0$, we also have
    \[
        \sum_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar} \beta_a u'_{a,s,t}
            > \sum_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar} \beta_a u'_{a,s,t}.
    \]
    Thus the objective value at $(\mu, \mat u')$ is strictly
    smaller than the one at $(\mu, \mat u)$, both of which are feasible points. 
    This contradicts the assumption that $(\mu, \mat u)$ is optimal. 
    We therefore conclude that none of these inequalities can be strict at points where $\beta_{a} > 0$.    
    This can be compactly written as: 
    \begin{align*}
        \forall (a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar.\quad
        \beta_a u_{a,s,t} &= \beta_a \mu(s,t) \log \frac{\mu(s,t)}{\p_a(t|s)\mu(s)} \\
        \implies\qquad
        \sum_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar}\beta_a u_{a,s,t} 
            &= \sum_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar} \beta_a \mu(s,t) \log \frac{\mu(s,t)}{\p_a(t|s)\mu(s)} \\
            &= \OInc_{\dg M}(\mu).
    \end{align*}
    % Therefore, the objective value must $\mu$ must minimize $\OInc_{\dg M}$.
    And, since $\mu$ minimizes this quantity

\end{lemma}
\begin{lproof}
    For this, we begin by appealing to the algorithm and analysis of
    \textcite{badenbroek2021algorithm}, threading details through for this specific choice of cone $K$. 
    To finish the proof, however, we will also need to supplement that analysis with some other well-established results of \textcite{nesterov1996infeasible} that the authors were no doubt familiar with, but did not bother referencing.
    % where the conic constraint is $K_{\exp}^n$.
    
    % First, we'll need quite a few definitions.
    % First, some definitions.
    First, we'll need some background material from convex optimization.
    A \emph{logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier} with parameter $\nu$ ($\nu$-LHSCB) for a cone $K$ is a thrice differentiable strictly convex function $F: \mathrm{int}\, K \to \mathbb R$ satisfying
    $F(tx) = F(x) - \nu \log t$
    for all $t > 0$ and $x \in \mathrm{int}\, K$. 
    In some sense, the point of such a barrier function is to augment the optimization objective so that we remain within the cone during the optimization process. 
    
    % Consider a point $\mat x = (\mat x_1, \mat x_2, \mat x_3) \in K_{\exp}^n$, 
        % where $\mat x_1, \mat x_2, \mat x_3 \in \mathbb R^{n}$. 
    % Consider a point $\mat x = 
    % (x^1_1, \ldots, x_n^1, x^2_1, \ldots, x^2_n, x^3_1, \ldots, x^3_n) 
    % (x_1^1, x_2^1, x_3^1, \ldots, x_1^n, x_2^n, x_3^n) 
    % \in K_{\exp}^n$.
        % where $\mat x_1, \mat x_2, \mat x_3 \in \mathbb R^{n}$. 
    
    % We now take a break from their presentation to 
    For the positive orthant cone $\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$, the function 
        $x \mapsto - \log x$ is a 1-LHSCB. 
    We now fill in some background facts about exponential cones.
    The \emph{dual} the exponential cone is

    \begin{align*}
        K_{\exp}^* &:= \big\{ (s_1, s_2, s_3) \in \mathbb R^3 \;:\;
            \forall (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in K_{\exp}.~~
            x_1 s_1 + x_2 s_2 + x_3 s_3 \ge 0   \big\}\\
            &= \big\{
                (s_1, s_2, s_3) \;:\; - s_1 \log (- s_1 / s_3) + s_1 - s_2 \le 0, 
                    \, s_1 \le 0,\,  s_3 \ge 0
            \big\}.
    \end{align*}
    Consider points $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in K_{\exp}$. 
    The function 
    \begin{equation}
        F_{\exp}(x) := - \log \Big(x_2 \log\frac{x_1}{x_2} - x_3\Big) - \log x_1 x_2

    % is a $3n$-LHSB for $K_{\exp}^n$, since
    is a $3$-LHSCB for $K_{\exp}$, since
    \begin{align*}
        F_{\exp}(t x) &= 
            -\log \Big( t x_2 \log \frac{t x_1}{t x_2} - t x_3\Big) - \log(t^2 x_1 x_2) \\
            % \sum_{i=1}^{n} - \log \Big( t x_2^i \log \frac{t x_1^i}{t x_2^i} - t x_3^i\Big) - \log(t^2 x_1^i x_2^i) \\ 
        % &= - \log \Big(t \big(\log \frac{x_1}{x_2} - x_3\big)\Big) - \log(x_1 x_2) - 2 \log t \\
        &= - \log \Big(t \big(\log \frac{x_1}{x_2} - x_3\big)\Big) - \log(x_1 x_2) - 2 \log t \\
        &= F_{\exp}(x) - 3 \log t
    \end{align*}
    % Taking $k$ copies of a cone, each of which has a $\nu$-LHSCB, allows for a $(k\nu)$-LHSCB by summation.
    Such barrier functions can be combined to act on product cones by summation. 
    Concretely, suppose that for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$,
    we have a $\nu_i$-LHSCB $F_i: \mathrm{int}\, K_i \to \Rext$.
    Then, for $x = (x_i)_{i=1}^k \in \prod_i K_i$, the function
    $F(x) := \sum_{i=1}^k F_i(x_i)$ is a $(\sum_i \nu_i)$-LHSCB for $\prod_i K_i$,
    since
    \[
        F(tx) = \sum_{i=1}^k F_i(t x_i)
            = \sum_{i=1}^k ( F(x_i) - \nu_i \log t)
            = F(x) - \sum_{i=1}^k \nu_i.
    \]
    %
    In this way, our product cone $K = \mathbb R_{\ge 0}^{n_{\sf o}} \times K^{n_{\sf e}}_{\exp}$ admits a LHSCB $F$ with parameter $\nu = n_{\sf o} + 3 n_{\sf e} = n$. 
    Furthermore can be evaluated in $O(n)$ time, as can each component of
    its gradient $F'(x)$ and Hessian $F''(x) \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$ at $x$, all of which can be expressed analytically.

    % Infeasible-start primal-dual interior point methods \parencite{nesterov1996infeasible}
    % Interior point methods 
    Generally speaking, 
    the idea behind primal-dual interior point methods \parencite{nesterov1994book} such as the one behind MOSEK, is 
    to maintain both a point $x \in K$ and a dual point $s \in K_*$ (as well as $y \in \mathbb R^m$)
    and iteratively update them, as we slowly relax the barrier and approach a point on the boundary of the cone. 
    The quantity $\mu(z) := \nf{\langle s, x \rangle}{\nu} \ge 0$, called the complementarity gap, is a measure of how close the process is to converging. 
    
    Because the initial points may not satisfy the constraints, instead 
    the standard algorithms work with ``extended points'' $\bar x = (x, \tau)$ and $\bar s = (s, \kappa)$, for which the analogous complementarity gap is 
    $\mu^{\sf e}(\bar x, \bar s) := (\langle x, s\rangle + \kappa\tau)/(\nu+1)$.
    Altogether, the data at each iteration may be summarized as a point $z = (y, x, \tau, s, \kappa) \in \mathbb R \times (K \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0}) \times (K_* \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0})$.
        % The development requires a
    The primary object of interest is then something called the \emph{homogenous self-dual} model.
    Originally due to \textcite{nesterov1996infeasible} and also used by others \parencite{skajaa2015homogeneous},
    it can be defined as a linear operator:
    \begin{align*}
        G
            &: \Rext^{m + 2n + 2} \to \Rext^{n + m + 1} \\
        G(y,x,\tau,s,\kappa) 
            &:= \begin{bmatrix}
                0          &  A  &  -b \\
                -A^{\sf T} &  0  &  c \\
                b^{\sf T}  & -c^{\sf T} & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            y \\ x \\ \tau
        \end{bmatrix}
        -
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0 \\ s \\k
        \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{align*}
    The reason for our interest is that if $z$ is such that $G(z) = 0$ and $\tau > 0$, then $(\nf x\tau)$ is a solution to the primal problem, and $\nf{(y,s)}{\tau}$ is a solution to the dual problem \parencite[Lemma 1]{skajaa2015homogeneous}, while if $G(z) = 0$ and $\kappa > 0$, then at least one of the two problems is infeasible. 
    
    % which is an $(3n+m+1)$-dimensional square matrix. 
    % which is a linear operator $G$
    We now are in a better position to describe the algorithm.    
    According to the MOSEK documentation \parencite{dahl2022primal,MOSEKDOC},
        for the exponential cone,
            begins with an initial point
        \[
            \mat v := (1.291, 0.805, -0.828) \in (K_{\exp} \,\cap\, K_{\exp}^*)
        \]
    
        for this particular cone $K$, 
    % the algorithm initializes a guess
    the algorithm begins at the initial point

    \end{align*}
    
    \def\daff#1{\Delta {#1}^{\text{aff}}}
    \def\dcen#1{\Delta {#1}^{\text{cen}}}
    
    At each iteration, the first step is to predict a direction for which 
    \textcite{badenbroek2021algorithm}
    compute a scaling matrix $W$.
    To describe it, we first need to define \emph{shadow iterates}
    \[
        \tilde x := -F'_*(s)
        \qquad \text{and} \qquad
        \tilde s := - F'(x).
    \]
    which are in a sense reflections of $s$ and $x$ across their barrier functions, and can be computed in in $O(n)$ time. 
    The analogous notion of complementarity can then be defined as $\tilde \mu(z) := \nicefrac{\langle \tilde x, \tilde s \rangle}{\nu}$.
    The scaling matrix, which we do not interpret here, can then be calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
        W :=
            \mu F''(x) + \frac{s s^{\sf T}}{\nu \mu}
            - \frac{\mu \tilde s \tilde s^{\sf T}}{\nu}
            + \frac{(s- \mu\tilde s)(s-\mu\tilde s)^{\sf T}}
                    {(s-\mu\tilde s)^{\sf T} (x - \mu \tilde x) }
            - \frac{\mu [ F''(x) \tilde x - \tilde \mu \tilde s]
                [ F''(x) \tilde x - \tilde \mu \tilde s]^{\sf T}}
                % { \Vert \tilde x \Vert^2_x - \nu \tilde \mu^2}
                { \tilde x^{\sf T} F''(x) \tilde x - \nu \tilde \mu^2}
        \label{eq:scalemat}
    \end{equation}
    Doing so requires $O(n^2)$ steps (although it may be parallelized). 
    The first four terms clearly require $O(n^2)$ steps, since each one is an outer product resulting in a $n \times n$ matrix. 
    The last term computes a matrix-vector product (which requires $O(n^2)$ steps), and computes an outer product with the resulting vector, which takes $O(n^2)$ steps as well. 
    
    The next step involves finding a solution $\daff z = (\cdots)$
    to the system of equations
    \begin{subequations} \label{eqns:sys1}
    \begin{align}
        G(\daff z) &= -G(z) \\
        \tau \daff\kappa + \daff\tau &= - \tau \kappa \\
        W \daff x + \daff s &= -s
    \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    
    % Since $\mathrm{dim}\,(z) = 6n+m+2$ and $\mathrm{dim}\,(x) = 3n$,
    % \eqref{eqns:sys1} is a system of $(3n + m + 1) + 1 + (3n) = 6n + m + 2$ equations
    (\ref{eqns:sys1}a-c) describe a system of $(n + m + 1) + 1 + (n) = 2n + m + 2$ equations and equally many unknowns, 
    % which can be solved naively with Gaussian elimination in $O((n+m)^3)$ iterations,
    % or with slightly better asymptotic complexity of
    % $O((n+m)^{2.332})$.
    and solved in $O((n+m)^\omega)$ steps.
    It may be possible to exploit the sparsity of $G$ to do better.
    
    The next step is to center that search direction so that it lies on the central path. This is done by finding a solution $\dcen z$ to
    \begin{subequations}\label{eqns:sys2}
    \begin{align}
        G(\dcen z) &= G(z) \\
        \tau \dcen \kappa + \kappa \dcen \tau &= \mu^e \\
        W \dcen x + \dcen s &= \mu^e \tilde s
    \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    which again can be done in $O((n+m)^3)$ steps with Gaussian elimination, or
    with a fancier solver in $O((n+m)^2.332)$ steps. 
    %
    The two updates are then applied to the current point $z$ to obtain
    \[
        z_+ = (y_+, x_+, \tau_+, s_+, \kappa_+) := z + \alpha (\daff z + \gamma \dcen z).
    \]
    
    Finally, a ``correction step'', which is the primary innovation of \textcite{badenbroek2021algorithm} and used in MOSEK's algorithm, 
    is a third direction $\Delta z_+^{\text{cor}}$, which is found by solving the system of equations
    \begin{subequations}\label{eqns:sys3}
    \begin{align}
        G(\Delta z^{\text{cor}}) &= 0 \\
        \tau_+ \Delta \kappa^{\text{cor}}  + \kappa_+ \Delta \tau^{\text{cor}} &= 0 \\
        W_+ \Delta {x_+}^{\text{cor}} + \dcen s &= \mu^e \tilde s
    \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    where
    % \[
    %     W_+ :=
    %         \mu_+ F''(x_) + \frac{s s^{\sf T}}{\nu \mu}
    %         - \frac{\mu \tilde s \tilde s^{\sf T}}{\nu}
    %         + \frac{(s- \mu\tilde s)(s-\mu\tilde s)^{\sf T}}
    %                 {(s-\mu\tilde s)^{\sf T} (x - \mu \tilde x) }
    %         - \frac{\mu [ F''(x) \tilde x - \tilde \mu \tilde s]
    %             [ F''(x) \tilde x - \tilde \mu \tilde s]^{\sf T}}
    %             % { \Vert \tilde x \Vert^2_x - \nu \tilde \mu^2}
    %             { \tilde x^{\sf T} F''(x) \tilde x - \nu \tilde \mu^2}
    % \]
    $W_+$ is defined the same way that $W$ is, except that it uses the components of $z_+$ instead of $z$.     
    After adding the correction step $\Delta z_+^{\text{cor}}$ to $z$, we repeat the entire process. The full algorithm, then, is summarized as follows:

        % \State $z \gets (y_0, x_0, \tau_0, s_0, \kappa_0)$ as in \eqref{bbeq:init};
        \STATE $z \gets (y_0, x_0, \tau_0, s_0, \kappa_0)$;
        \WHILE{}
            \STATE Compute scaling matrix $W$ as in \eqref{eq:scalemat};
            \STATE Find the solution $\daff z$ to (\ref{eqns:sys1}a-c),
                and the solution $\dcen z$ to (\ref{eqns:sys2}a-c);
            \STATE $z_+ \gets z + \alpha (\daff z + \gamma \dcen z)$;
            \STATE Compute the saling matrix $W_+$;
            \STATE Find the solution $\Delta z^{\text{cor}}_+$ to (\ref{eqns:sys3}a-c);
            \STATE $z \gets z_+ + \Delta z_+^{\text{cor}}$;
        \ENDWHILE
    \end{algorithmic}
    
    % and each iteration of it takes $O((n+m)^{2.332})$ time. 
    We have verified that each iteration of this process can be done in $O((n+m)^\omega))$ time.
    Their main result \parencite[Theorem 3]{badenbroek2021algorithm}, states that for every $\epsilon \in (0,1)$,
    the algorithm results in a solution $z$ satisfying
    \[
        \mu^{\sf e}(z)
        % \frac{x^{\sf T} s + \tau \kappa}{3n + 1}
        \le \epsilon
        \qquad \text{and}\qquad
        \Vert G(z) \Vert \le \epsilon 
            \Vert G(z_0) \Vert 
            % \sqrt{3n + 1}
    \]
    in $O(n \log (1/\epsilon))$ iterations, 
    for a total cost of 
    $O(n (m+n)^3 \log (1/\epsilon) )$ time with Gaussian elimination, or
    $O(n (m+n)^{2.332} \log (1/\epsilon) )$ time using the linear solver with best
         known asymptotatic complexity as of 2022.

    \textbf{Verifying that the solution is approximately optimal.} 
    What we have at this point is not quite enough: simply because the residual quantity $G(z)$ is approximately zero (so that we have approximately solved the homogenous model), does not mean that we've approximately solved the original problem.
    Specifically, it's entirely possible on the surface that the parameter $\tau$ goes to zero at the same rate as everything else, and the quantity $(x/\tau)$ does not converge to a solution to the primal problem.
    To address this issue, we must also trace the analysis of the seminal work of \textcite{nesterov1996infeasible}, who use slightly different quantities, conflicting with the notation we have been using thus far.
     
     
    Following \textcite[pg. 231]{nesterov1996infeasible}, fix an initial point $z_0$, and let \emph{shifted feasible set} 
    $\mathcal F := \{ z
        \in \mathbb R \times K \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \times K^* \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0}
        : G(z) = G(z_0)\}$
    be the collection of all points that have the same residual as $z_0$.     
    \citeauthor*{nesterov1996infeasible} also refer to a complementary gap by $\mu(z)$ and define it identically, but the meaning of this parameter is different, because the set $\mathcal F$ on which it's defined is quite distinct from (if closely related to) the iterates of \citeauthor*{badenbroek2021algorithm}'s algorithm.
    In the service of clarity, 
    will call this quantity $\mu^{\sf N}(z^{\sf N})$, for 
    $z^{\sf N}
    = (y^{\sf N}, x^{\sf N}, \tau^{\sf N}, s^{\sf N}, \kappa^{\sf N})
    \in \mathcal F$.
    
    
    Although we made a point of emphasizing that the two are distinct, 
    the actual relationship between them is straightforward.
    Let $z = (y, x,\tau, s, \kappa)$ be the final output of \textcite{badenbroek2021algorithm}. 
    % Because they also prove that
    In proving their main theorem, they also prove that
    $G(z) = \epsilon G(z_0)$,  and $\mu^{\sf e}=\epsilon$;
    because $G$ is linear, we know that $G(\nf{z}{\epsilon}) = G(z_0)$.
    This means that $z^{\sf N} 
    := \nf z\epsilon \in \mathcal F$. 
    % This is precisely what it means for $\frac{z}{\epsilon}$ to be a member of the \emph{shifted feasible set} $\mathcal F$ defined by \textcite[pg. 231]{nesterov1996infeasible}.
    Therefore, 
    \[  
        \mu^{\sf N}(z^{\sf N} )
        = \frac{1}{\nu+1} \left( \left\langle\frac{s}{\epsilon}, \frac{x}{\epsilon}\right\rangle + \frac{\tau}{\epsilon} \frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} \right) 
    = \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \mu^{\sf e}(z) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}.
    \]
    % where $(*)$ is the definition of $\mu^{\sf e}$. 
    So, roughly speaking, $\mu^{\sf N}$ and $\mu^{\sf e}$ are reciprocals.
    % They also
    \citeauthor*{badenbroek2021algorithm} also
    prove that, every iterate $z$ satisfies their assumption (A2): for a fixed constant $\beta$ (equal to 0.9 in their analysis), $\beta \mu^{\sf e}(z) \le \tau \kappa$. 
    Consequently, 
    it happens that the same inequality holds with Nesterov's notation: 
    \[ 
        \tau^{\sf N} \kappa^{\sf N} = 
        \frac{\tau}{\epsilon} \frac{\kappa}{\epsilon}
            = \frac{\tau\kappa}{\epsilon^2} \ge \frac{\beta \epsilon}{\epsilon^2}
            = \frac\beta\epsilon = \beta \mu^{\sf N}
                % \left(\frac{z}{\epsilon}\right)
                (z^{\sf N}).
    \]
    This witnesses that $z^{\sf N} = \frac{z}{\epsilon}$ satisfies equation (81) of \citeauthor{nesterov1996infeasible}, which allows us to apply one of their main theorems, thereby resolving our problems.
    Supposing that the orignal problem is solvable, 
    let $(x^*, s^*)$ be any solution to the primal and dual problems,
    and define the value $\psi := 1 + \langle s_0, x^*\rangle + \langle s^*, x_0 \rangle \ge 1$, 
    which depends only on the problem and the choice of initialization.
    Then Theroem 1, part 1 of \citeauthor*{nesterov1996infeasible}, allows us to conclude that
    \[
        \frac{\kappa}{\epsilon}  \le \psi
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \frac\tau\epsilon \ge \frac{\beta}{\epsilon\psi}
    %
    \qquad\qquad \iff\qquad\qquad
        \kappa \le \epsilon\psi
        \quad\text{and}\quad \tau \ge \frac\beta\psi.    
    \]
    Finally, the original theorem guarantees that 
    $\Vert G(x) \Vert \le \epsilon \Vert G(z_0)\Vert$, meaning that
    \[
        \Big\Vert A \Big(\frac x\tau\Big) - b \Big\Vert \tau
        ~+~\Big\Vert A^{\sf T} \Big(\frac y\tau\Big) - \frac{s}\tau - c \Big\Vert \tau
        ~+~\Big\Vert b^{\sf T} \left(\frac{y}{\tau}\right) - c^{\sf T} \left(\frac{x}{\tau}\right) - \frac\kappa\tau \Big\Vert \tau \le \epsilon \Vert G(z_0) \Vert
    \]
    Since the euclidean norm is an upper bound on the deviation in any component
    ( $\Vert v \Vert := \sqrt{\sum_i v_i^2} \ge \sqrt{\max_i v_i^2} = \max_i v_i =: \Vert v\Vert_\infty$ ), this means that in light of our bound on $\tau$ above, we have
    \[
        \Big\Vert A \Big(\frac x\tau\Big) - b \Big\Vert_\infty
        ~+~\Big\Vert A^{\sf T} \Big(\frac y\tau\Big) + \frac{s}\tau - c \Big\Vert_\infty 
        ~+~\Big\Vert b^{\sf T} \left(\frac{y}{\tau}\right) - c^{\sf T} \left(\frac{x}{\tau}\right) - \frac\kappa\tau \Big\Vert_\infty
        \le \epsilon  \frac{\beta \Vert G(z_0) \Vert}{\psi }.
    \]
    The first two components show that the total constraint violation (in the primal and dual problems, respectively) is at most $\nicefrac{\epsilon\beta}{\psi} \Vert G(z_0) \Vert$.
    Meanwhile, the final component shows that the duality gap 
    $\mathit{gap} = b^{\sf T} (\frac{y}{\tau}) - c^{\sf T} (\frac{x}{\tau})$,
    which is positive and an upper bound on the difference between the objective at $x/\tau$ and the optimal objective value, satisfies
    \[   
        \mathit{gap}  \le \mathit{gap} + \frac\kappa\tau \le \frac{\epsilon \beta \Vert G(z_0) \Vert}{\psi}.
    \]    
    Thus $x/\tau$ is an approximate solution to the original exponential conic problem.
    Since also $\psi \ge 1$, we may freely drop it to get a looser bound.
    All that remains is to investigate
    \[
        \Vert G(z_0) \Vert
        = \Vert A x_0 - b \Vert
            + \Vert A^{\sf T} y_0 + s_0 - c  \Vert
            + | c^{\sf T} x - b^{\sf T} y + 1 |.
    \]
    Making use of our final assumption, that every component of $A$, $b$, and $c$ is at most one, we find that
    \begin{align*}
        \Vert A x_0 - b \Vert^2 
            &= \sum_j (\sum_i A_{j,i} (1.3)  - b_j)^2 
            % \le \sum_j (1.3n - b_j)^2
            \le m (1.3n+1)^2 \in O(m n^2)
                &\subset O((m+n)^3)\\
        \Vert A^{\sf T}y_0 + s_0 - c \Vert^2 
            &= \sum_i (\sum_j (A_{j,i})
            \le n (m + 2)^2 \in O(n m^2)
                &\subset O((m+n)^3) \\
        | c^{\sf T} x - b^{\sf T} y + 1 | ^2
            &\le (1.3n + m + 1)^2 \in O( (n+m)^2 )
                &\subset O((n+m)^3).
    \end{align*}
    Therefore $G(z_0) \in O((n+m)^{\nf32})$. 
    So, to attain machine precision $\epsilon_0$ (say, $10^{-15}$), it suffices to take $\frac{1}{\epsilon} \le O((n+m)^{\nf32}) $.
    Thus, we arrive at our total advertised asymptotic complexity of
    \[
        O( n (n+m)^\omega \log (n+m) ) \text{~steps}. 
    \]
\end{lproof}

\begin{conj}
\color{red}
    It can also be solved with the methods of \textcite{skajaa2015homogeneous} in
    time
    \[ O(\sqrt{n} (m+n)^\omega \log n ) 
        \quad\subset\quad O( (m+n)^{2.872} \log n ) 
        % \qquad \text{time.}
        \]
\end{conj}

Having combed through all of the details of the analysis of  \textcite{badenbroek2021algorithm} and \textcite{nesterov1996infeasible} for exponential
conic programs as we have defined them, we are ready to show that this algorithm solves the problems presented in \cref{sec:clique-tree-expcone} within polynomial time. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cluster-inc-polytime}
Problem \eqref{prob:cluster-inc} is solved to machine precision in time
\[
    O\Big( (\V\!\Ar + \V\C)^{1 + \omega} ( \log (\V\!\Ar + \V\C) 
        % + \log(1+ \Vert\bbeta\Vert_\infty)) \Big)
        + \log(1+ \max_a\beta_a)) \Big)
    \quad \subset \quad
        \tilde O\Big( (\V\!\Ar + \V\C)^4 \Big)
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{lproof}
    Problem \eqref{prob:cluster-inc}
    % has $\V\!\Ar + $ constraints.
    can translated via the DCP framework to 
    the following exponential conic program, which has:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\blacktriangleright$]
    \item variables 
        $x = (\mat u, \mat v, \mat w, \bmu) \in K_{\exp}^{\V\!\Ar} \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0}^{\V \C}$, 
        where 
        \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item $\mathbf{u, v,w} \in \Rext^{\V\!\Ar}$
            are all vectors over $\V\!\Ar$,
            that at index $\iota = (a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$, have 
            components $u_\iota$, $v_\iota$, and $w_\iota$, respectively;
            % components 
            % $\mat u = [u_{a,s,t}]_{ast\in\V\!\Ar},
            %  \mat v = [v_{a,s,t}]_{ast\in\V\!\Ar}$, 
            % and $\mat w = [w_{a,s,t}]_{ast\in\V\!\Ar}$ respectively, 
            % respective components
            % $(\mat u; \mat v; \mat w) = []_{(a,s,t)\in\V\!\Ar}$
        \item
            $\bmu = [\mu_{C}(C{=}c)]_%
            % {(C,c) \in \V\C}
            {C \in \C,\,c \in\V C}
             \in \Rext^{\V \C}$ is a vector representation of a clique tree over clusters $\C$;
    \end{itemize}

    \item constraints as follows:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item 
            two linear constraints for every $(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$ to ensure that
            \begin{align*}
                v_{a,s,t} &= \mu_{C_{\!a}}\!(s,t)
                    \qquad\Big(~= \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C_a \setminus\{\Src a, \Tgt a\})}
                        \mu_{C_{\!a}}\!(\bar c, s, t) \Big) \\
                \qquad\text{and}\qquad
                w_{a,s,t} &= \mu_{C_{\!a}}\!(\Src a{=}s)\, \p_a(\Tgt a{=}t\mid\Src a{=}s)
                    \qquad\Big(~= \p_a(\Tgt a{=}t\mid\Src a{=}s) \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C_a \setminus\{\Src a\})}
                        \mu_{C_{\!a}}\!(\bar c, s) \Big)
            \end{align*}
            \item for every edge $(C\!{-}\!D) \in \cal T$, and every value $\omega \in \V(C \cap D)$ of the variables that clusters $C$ and $D$ have in common, a linear constraint
            \[
                \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C\setminus D)} \mu_C(\bar c, \omega) 
                    =
                \sum_{\bar d \in \V(D \setminus C)} \mu_D(\bar d, \omega)
            \]
            \item and one constraint for each cluster $C \in \C$ to ensure that $\mu_{C}$ lies on the probability simplex, i.e.,
            \[
                \sum_{c \in \V C} \mu_C(c) = 1.
            \]     
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    Altogether this means that we have an exponential conic program in the form
    of \cref{lem:mainlemma}, with
    % \begin{itemize}
        % \item 
        $n = 3|\V\!\Ar| + |\V\C|$ variables,
        and
        % \item 
        $m = 2 |\V\!\Ar| + |\V \mathcal T| +  |\C|$ constraints,
    where
    $\V\mathcal T = \{ (C\!{-}\!D, \omega) :  C\!{-}\!D \in \mathcal T, \omega \in \V(C\cap D)\}$.
    Since we can simply disregard variables whose value sets are singletons, we can assume $\V C > 1$; summing over all clusters yields $\V\C > |\C|$. 
    At the same time, since $\V\mathcal T \le \V\C$, 
    we have 
    \[ m,n,(m + n) \in O(\V\!\Ar, + \V\C).  \]
        % \footnote{by analogy to all of the other quantities}

    
    We now give the explicit construction of the data $(A, b,c)$ of the exponential conic program that \eqref{prob:cluster-inc} compiles to.
    The variables are indexed by tuples
    of the form $i = (\ell,a,s,t)$ for $(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$ and $\ell \in \{u,v,w\}$, 
    or by tuples of the form $(C,c)$, for $c \in \V C$ and $C \in \C$, 
    while the
    constraints are indexed by tuples of the form
    $j = (\ell,a,s,t)$ for $(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$ and $\ell \in \{v,w\}$, 
    of the form $(C\!{-}\!D, \omega)$, for an edge $(C\!{-}\!D) \in \mathcal T$ and $\omega \in \V(C \cap D)$, 
    or simply by $(C)$, the name of a cluster $C \in \C$. 
    Then, the problem data $A = [A_{j,i}],b = [b_j],c = [c_i]$ of this program are zero, except (possibly) for the
        components:
    \begin{align*}
        c_{(u,a,s,t)} &= \beta_a \\
        % c_{(w,a,s,t)} &=  c_{(v,a,s,t)} = c_{(C,c)} = 0. 
        A_{(v,a,s,t), (C,c)} &= 
        \mathbbm1[C {=} C_{a} ~\land~ \Src a(c) {=} s ~\land~ \Tgt a(c) {=} t] \\
        %  \begin{cases}
        %     1 & \text{if }C = C_a,\,
        %         \Src a(c) = s,~\text{ and } \Tgt a(c) = t\\
        %     0 & \text{ otherwise}
        % \end{cases} \\
        A_{(w,a,s,t), (C,c)} &= 
           %  \begin{cases}
           %     \p_a(\Tgt a{=}t\mid \Src a{=}s)
           %     % \p_a(t|s)
           %      & \text{if }C = C_a\text{ and }
           %         \Src a(c) = s\\
           %     0 & \text{ otherwise}
           % \end{cases}  \\
           \p_a(\Tgt a{=}t\mid \Src a{=}s) 
            \mathbbm1[C {=} C_a ~\land~ \Src a(c) {=} s] \\
        A_{(w,a,s,t), (w,a,s,t)} &= -1 \\
        A_{(v,a,s,t), (v,a,s,t)} &= -1 \\
        % A_{(C'),(C,c)} &= \begin{cases}
        %         1 & \text{ if } C = C' \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}
        %     \end{cases}\\
        % A_{(C{-}D, \omega), (C,c)} &= 1\\
        % A_{(D{-}C, \omega), (C,c)} &= -1\\
        A_{(C\!{-}\!D, \omega),(C',c)} &= \mathbbm1[C{=}C'] - \mathbbm1[C'{=}D]\\
        % A_{(C), (C',c)} &= \mathbbm1[C{=}C'] \\
        A_{(C),(C,c)} &= 1 \\
        b_{(C)} &= 1,
    \end{align*}
    where, $\mathbbm1[\varphi]$ is equal to 1 if $\varphi$ is true, and zero if $\varphi$ is false.
    We note that we can equivalently divide each $\beta_a$ by $\max_a \beta_a$ without affecting the problem, 
    although this could affect the approximation accuracy by the same factor. 
    
    % We have arrived at our result:
    To summarize, applying \Cref{lem:mainlemma}, we find that we can solve problem \eqref{prob:cluster-inc} in time
    \begin{align*}
        O\Big( (\V\!\Ar + \V\C)^{1 + \omega} ( \log (\V\!\Ar + \V\C) + \log( \Vert\bbeta\Vert_\infty)) \Big)
        \quad
        \subset \tilde O\Big( (\V\!\Ar + \V\C)^4 \Big).
    \end{align*}
\end{lproof}

We now quickly step through the analogous construction for problems \eqref{prob:cluster-small-gamma} and \eqref{prob:cluster+idef}, which
solve the $\gamma$-inference problem, and $\epsilon$-inference, respectively.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:smallgamma-polytime}
    Problem \eqref{prob:cluster-small-gamma} is solved to machine precision in time
    \[
        O\Big( |\V\!\Ar + \V\C|^{1 + \omega} ( \log (\V\!\Ar + \V\C) + \log(1+ \Vert\bbeta\Vert_\infty) + \log \log \frac{1}{p}) \Big)
        \quad
        \subset 
        \quad
        \tilde O\Big( (\V\!\Ar + \V\C)^4 \Big)

            two linear constraints for each $(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$, to ensure that
            \[
                y_{a,s,t} = \mu_{C_{\!a}}(s,t)

            \item for every edge $(C\!{-}\!D) \in \cal T$, and every value $\omega \in \V(C \cap D)$ of the variables that clusters $C$ and $D$ have in common, a linear constraint
            \[

            \TODO[POSSIBLE ISSUE: doesn't this mean the problem isn't strictly feasible?]

             
            \item a linear constraint for every value $c \in \V C$ of every cluster $C \in \C$, to ensure that
            \[
                z_{C,c} = \mu_C( \Pash_C(c) )
                    \qquad \Big(~~= \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C \setminus \Pash_C)}

            \item and one constraint for each cluster $C \in \C$ to ensure that $\mu_{C}$ lies on the probability simplex, i.e.,
            \[
                \sum_{c \in \V C} \mu_C(c) = 1.
            \]
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    So in total, there are 
    $n = |3 \V \!\Ar + 3 \V \C|$ variables,
    and 
    $m = 2 |\V\!\Ar| + |\V \mathcal T| + |\V\!\Ar^0| + |\V \C| + |\C|$ constraints. 
    The same arguments made in \cref{lem:cluster-inc-polytime} show that both $n,m \in O(|\V \!\Ar + \V \C|)$.
    
    Also like before, it is easy to see that the components of $A$ and $b$ are all at most 1.  Here, however, to rescale the objective $c$ to be at most 1 at every component, we will need to divide by 
    $\max \{ - \beta_a \log {p_a(t|s)} \}_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar} \cup \{ 1 \}$
    
    This gives rise to our result: problem \eqref{prob:cluster-small-gamma} can be solved in 
    \begin{align*}
        O\left( |\V \!\Ar + \V \C|^{1+\omega} 
            \left(\log |\V \!\Ar + \V \C| + \log\left(1 + \max_{(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar} \beta_a \log \frac{1}{\p_a(t|s)} \right) \right)  \right) \\
        \subset 
        O\left( |\V \!\Ar + \V \C|^{1+ \omega} 
            \log |\V \!\Ar + \V \C|
            \log (\beta ) \log\log \frac{1}{p} \right)
    \end{align*}
    operations, where $p$ is the smallest nonzero probability in the PDG, and $\beta$ is the largest confidence in the PDG larger than 1.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cluster+idef-polytime}
    Problem \eqref{prob:cluster+idef} is solved to machine precision in

        \quad\subset\quad
        \tilde O\Big( |\V \C + \V \! \Ar|^{4} \Big) \text{~~time}.
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{lproof}
    Problem \eqref{prob:cluster+idef} is slightly more straightforward; having done
    \cref{lem:cluster-inc-polytime,lem:smallgamma-polytime} in depth, we do this one more quickly.
    In the standard form, problem \eqref{prob:cluster+idef}, has variables 
    $x = (\mat u, \bmu, \mat w)
        \in K_{\exp}^{\V\C}$.
    The constraints  are:
     
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
        \item 
        one linear constraint for each $(C,c) \in \V\C$, to ensure that
        \[
            w_{C,c} = k_{(C,c)} \mu_C( \Pash_C(c) )
            \qquad\Big(~~= \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C\setminus \Pash_C )} \mu_C(\bar c, \Pash_C(c))
                \Big)
        \]
        \item for every edge $(C\!{-}\!D) \in \cal T$, and every value $\omega \in \V(C \cap D)$ of the variables that clusters $C$ and $D$ have in common, a linear constraint
        \[
            \sum_{\bar c \in \V(C\setminus D)} \mu_C(\bar c, \omega) 
                =
            \sum_{\bar d \in \V(D \setminus C)} \mu_D(\bar d, \omega)
        \]
        \item for every $(a,s,t) \in \V\!\Ar$, a linear constraint
        that ensures
        \[
            \mu_{C_a}(\Src a{=}s, \Tgt a{=}t) \, \nu_{C_a}(\Src a{=}s)
                =
            \nu_{C_a}(\Src a{=}s, \Tgt a{=}t) \, \mu_{C_a}(\Src a{=}s).
        \]
        This is linear, because recall that $\nu$ is a constant in this optimization
        problem, found by having previously solved \eqref{prob:cluster-inc}. 
        
        \item and one constraint for each cluster $C \in \C$ to ensure that $\mu_{C}$ lies on the probability simplex.
    \end{itemize}
    So in total, there are 
    $n = 3 |\V \C|$ variables,
    and 
    $m =  |\V \C| + |\V \mathcal T| + |\V\!\Ar| + |\C|$ constraints. 
     % O(|\V \!\Ar + \V \C|)$.
    Once again, the components of $A$ and $b$ are all at most one, and now the compoents of the cost function $c = \mat 1$ are identically one. 
    Therefore \eqref{prob:cluster+idef} can be solved in 
    \begin{align*}
        O\Big( |\V \C| |\V \!\Ar + \V \C|^{\omega} 
            \log |\V \!\Ar + \V \C| \Big) 
        \quad\subset\quad
        \tilde O( |\V \C + \V \! \Ar|^{4} )
    \end{align*}
    operations.
\end{lproof}

\recall{theorem:main}
\begin{lproof}\label{proof:main}
    Suppose the PDG has $N$ variables 
    (each of which can take at most $V$ distinct values), 
    and $A$ hyperarcs, which together form a structure has tree-width $T$. 
    
    Then each cluster (of which there are at most $N$) 
    can have at most $T$ variables, and so can take at most $V^T$ values.
    Therefore, $|\V \C| \le N V^T$.
    % Furthermore, because each 
    Since each arc must be entirely contained within some cluster, 
    $|\V\!\Ar| \le A V^T$. 
    So, $|\V\!\Ar + \V \C| \le (N+A) V^T$. 
    
    Applying \cref{lem:cluster-inc-polytime,lem:smallgamma-polytime,lem:cluster+idef-polytime}, we conclude that PDG inference in any of the problems we've described, can be done in
    \[
        O\Big(  (N+A)^4 V^{4T} \log ((N+A) V^{4T}) \Big)
        % \subset
        % =
        % O\Big(  (N+A)^4 \exp\log(V^{4T}) \Big) 
        % = O\Big(  (N+A)^4 \exp(4T\log V) \Big) 
    \]

	\end{align*}
	% % Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.

	% % Smoothness.


	% Choose $\gamma < \min (\{1\}\cup\{ \beta^{\dg M}_L : L \in \Ed^{\dg M}\})$.
	Fix $\gamma < \min_L \beta_L$. Then we know that $\bbr{\dg X}_\gamma(\mu)$ is a $\gamma$-strongly convex function for every PDG $\dg X$, and hence there is a unique joint distribution which minimizes it.

	\textbf{Strict Convexity.}
	Suppose $p_1(Y \mid X)$ and $p_2(Y\mid X)$ are two cpds on $Y$ given $X$.
	Fix $\lambda \in [0,1]$, and set $p_\lambda = (1-\lambda) p_1 + \lambda p_2$.
	Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ and $\mu_\lambda$ be the joint distributions that minimze $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_1}_\gamma$, $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_2}_\gamma$ and $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma$, respectively.  Then we have
	\begin{equation*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma
			= \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(X,Y)}{p_\lambda(Y\mid X) \mu_\lambda( X)}.
	\end{equation*}
	By convexity of $\bbr{\dg M}$ and $\thickD$, we have
	\begin{align}
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda)
		 	&\le (\lambda-1)\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1) + \lambda \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	\label{eqn:score-cvx}\\
		\text{and}\qquad \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)}
			&\le (1-\lambda)\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \nonumber \\
			&\qquad+ \lambda\;\;\kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}.
				\label{eqn:D-cvx}
	\end{align}
	If $\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ then since $\bbr{\dg M}$ is strictly convex, \eqref{eqn:score-cvx} must
	be a strict inequality. On the other hand, if $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, then since $\mu_\lambda = \mu_1 = \mu_2$ and $\thickD$ is stricly convex in its second argument when its first argument is fixed (\Cref{lem:Dstrongcvx}), \eqref{eqn:D-cvx} must be a strict inequality.
	In either case, the sum of the two inequalities must be strict, giving us
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M \bundle p_\lambda}_\gamma &=
		\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_\lambda) + \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_\lambda(XY)}{p_\lambda(Y | X) \mu_\lambda( X)} \\
		&<
		 (\lambda-1) \left[\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_1)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_1(XY)}{p_1(Y | X) \mu_1( X)} \right]
			 \\[-0.3em]&\qquad\qquad
			 + \lambda \left[ \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu_2)
			 	+ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu_2(XY)}{p_2(Y | X) \mu_2( X)}
			 	\right] \\
		 &= (\lambda-1) \aar{\dg M \bundle p_1} + \lambda\,\aar{\dg M \bundle p_2},
	\end{align*}
	which shows that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}$ is \emph{strictly} convex in $p$, as desired.


	\textbf{Smoothness.}
	If $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*$ is a positive distribution, then by definition $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}$ achieves its minimum on the interior of the probability simplex $\Delta \V(\dg M \bundle p)$, and so by \Cref{lem:cvx4}, we immediately find that $\aar{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma$ is smooth in $p$.

	Now, suppose that $\bbr{\dg M \bundle p}_\gamma^*(\mat w) = 0$,  for some $\mat w \in \V(\dg M \bundle p)$.

	Applying \Cref{lem:cvx4} to the function $f = \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$

	Now for the second case.

	If $x^*_b \in \partial X$, then we claim that either
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item There is a subspace $T \subseteq \mathbb R^{m}$ with
			$\SD{}$
	 	\item There is a subspace $S \subseteq \mathbb R^{n}$ with
			$x^*_b \in S \cap \partial X$ such

	\end{enumerate}

\end{lproof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cvx4}
	Let $X$ and $Y$ be convex sets, and
	$f : X \times Y \to \mathbb R$ be a smooth $(C^\infty)$, convex function.
	If $f$ is strictly convex in $X$, and for some $y_0 \in Y$, $f(x, y_0)$ achieves its infemum on the interior of $X$.
	then $y\mapsto \inf_x f(x, y)$ is smooth $(C^\infty)$ at the point $y_0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lproof}%[Proof of \Cref{lem:cvx4}]
	% Let $f_y(x) = f(x,y)$.
	% Since $f$ is smooth and stritly convex, each restriction $f_y$ of $f$ to a
	% particular $y$ is also smooth and strictly convex.
	% As a result, each $f_y$ has a unique minimum $m_y := \inf_{x} f_y(x)$.
	% As $f_y$ is smooth, $m_y$ is either a boundary point, or
	% at a point where $\nabla f_y = 0$.
	%
	% Moreover, it is a constrained optimization problem, so
	% $\nabla_{x,y,\lambda} [ f(x,y) + \lambda (y_0 - y)] = 0$.
	%
	% \TODO
	Let $x_0^* := \arg\min_x f(x,y_0)$, which is achieved by assumption, and is unique because $f(-,y_0)$ is strictly convex.

	We will ultimately apply the implicit function theorem to give us a smooth function which is equal to this infemum, but to do so we must deal with the technicality that it requires an open set; the boundary is the most complicated part of this result.
	Here we have essentially required that the domain be open by fiat for $X$, but for $Y$ (which is a possibly non-open subset of $\mathbb R^m$), we use the Extension Lemma for smooth functions \cite[Lemma 2.26]{lee2013smooth}. In our context, it states that
	for every open set $U$ with $\overline{Y} \subseteq U \subseteq \mathbb R^m$,
	there exists a function $\tilde f : X \times \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb R$, such that $\tilde f |_{Y} = f$ (and $\supp \tilde f \subseteq U$).
	We only need a small fraction of this power: that we can smoothly extend $f$ to \emph{some} open set of $\mathbb R^m$, which we fix and call $\tilde Y$.

	% Similarly, for other $y \in Y$, let $x^*_y$ be the unique value of $x$ which minimizes $f(x,y)$.

	% \textbf{Smoothness.}
	% By assumption, $x^*_b$ is not a boundary point of $X$.
	%
	We claim that now all conditions for the Implicit Function Theorem are met if invoked with
		$\phi(y,x) := \vec\nabla_x \tilde f(x,y)$ and $(\mat b,\mat a) = (y_0, x^*_0)$.
	Concretely, we have $m = \mathop{dim} X$, $n = \mathop{dim} Y$, and $Z = (\tilde Y \times X)^\circ$, i.e., the interior of $\tilde Y \times X$, which is open and contains $(\mat b, \mat a)$.
	 Becuase $\phi$ is smooth, it is $k$-times differentiable for all $k$. We have $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f (y_0, x^*_0) = \vec 0$ because $x^*_0$ is a local minimum of the smooth function $\tilde f(-, y_0)$ which lies on the interior of $X$.

	Moreover, the Jacobian matrix
	\[ \mat J_{\nabla\!\tilde f, x}(y_0, x_0^*) = \left[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(x^*_0, y_0) \right]\]
	is the Hessian of the strictly convex funtion $f(-, b)$, and therefore positive definite (and in particular non-singular).
	Therefore, the Implicit Function Theorem guarantees us the existence of a neighborhood $U \subset \tilde Y$ of $y_0$ for which
	there is a unique $k$-times differentiable function $g: U \to X$ such that $g(y_0) = x^*_0$ and $\vec\nabla_x \tilde f(y, g(y)) = 0$ for all $y \in U$. Of course, this implies $g(y) = \argmin_x f(x,y)$ at every such point, and $\inf_x f(x,y) = f(g(y),y)$ is a composition of the smooth function $f$ with the $k$-times differentiable function $g \otimes \mathrm{id}_Y$.
	Therefore, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is itself $k$-times continuously differentiable at $y_0$ for all $k$, or in other words, $\inf_x f(x,y)$ is smooth at $y=y_0$.

\subsection{Hardness Results}

\recall{prop:consistent-NP-hard}
\begin{lproof} \label{proof:consistent-NP-hard}
	We can directly encode SAT problems as PDGs.
	Specifically, let
	$$\varphi := \bigwedge_{j \in \mathcal J} \bigvee_{i \in \mathcal I(j)} (X_{j,i})$$
	be a CNF formula over binary variables $\mat X := \bigcup_{j,i} X_{j,i}$. Let
	$\dg M_\varphi$ be the PDG containing every variable $X \in \mat X$ and a binary
	variable $C_j$ (taking the value 0 or 1) for each clause $j \in \mathcal J$, as well as the following edges, for each $j \in \mathcal J$:
	%\{$``$\varphi(\mat X)$''$\}$ with $\V(\varphi) = \{0,1\}$, and
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a hyperedge $\{X_{j,i} : i \in \mathcal I(j)\} \tto C_j$, together with a degenerate cpd
			encoding the boolean OR function (i.e., the truth of $C_j$ given $\{X_{j,i}\}$);
		\item an edge $\pdgunit \tto C_j$, together with a cpd asserting $C_j$ be equal to 1.
	\end{itemize}
	% We give each edge $\alpha = 0$ and $\beta = 1$.
	First, note that the number of nodes, edges, and non-zero entries in the cpds are polynomial in the $|\mathcal J|, |\mat X|$, and the total number of parameters in a simple matrix representation of the cpds is also polynomial if $\mathcal I$ is bounded (e.g., if $\varphi$ is a 3-CNF formula).
	A satisfying assignment $\mat x \models \varphi$ of the variables $\mat X$ can be regarded as a degenerate joint distribution $\delta_{\mat X = \mat x}$ on $\mat X$, and extends uniquely to a full joint distribution $\mu_{\mat x} \in \Delta \V(\dg M_\varphi)$ consistent with all of the edges, by
	\[ \mu_{\mat x} = \delta_{\mat x} \otimes \delta_{\{C_j = \vee_i  x_{j,i}\}} \]

 	Conversely, if $\mu$ is a joint distribution consistent with the edges above, then any point $\mat x$ in the support of $\mu(\mat X)$ must be a satisfying assignment, since the two classes of edges respectively ensure that $1 =\mu(C_j\!=\! 1 \mid \mat X \!=\! \mat x) = \bigvee_{i \in \mathcal I(j)} \mat x_{j,i}$ for all $j \in \mathcal J$, and so $\mat x \models \varphi$.

	Thus, $\SD{\dg M_\varphi} \ne \emptyset$ if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable, so
	an algorithm for determining if a PDG is consistent can also be adapted (in polynomial space and time) for use as a SAT solver, and so the problem of determining if a PDG consistent is NP-hard.

	\Cref{prop:consistent-NP-hard}.
	Furthemore, let $\bbr{\varphi} := \{ \mat x : \mat x \models \varphi \}$ be the set of  assingments to $\mat X$ satisfying $\varphi$, and $\#_\varphi := |\bbr{\dg M}|$ denote the number such assignments. We now claim that
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:number-of-solns}
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right].
	\end{equation}
 	If true, we would have a reduced the \#P-hard problem of computing $\#_\varphi$ to the problem of computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma$. We now proceed with proof \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns}.
	By definition, we have
	\[ \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = \inf_\mu \Big[ \OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) + \gamma \SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \Big]. \]
	We start with a claim about first term.
	% For the particular PDG $\dg M_\varphi$, the

	\begin{iclaim} \label{claim:separate-inc-varphi}
		% $\OInc(\dg M_\varphi)$ is finite if and only if $\varphi$ is statisfiable.
		$\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) =
		% \begin{cases}
		% 	0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
		% 	 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
		% 	\infty & \text{otherwise}
		% \end{cases}
		\begin{cases}
			0 & \text{if}~  \supp \mu \subseteq \bbr{\varphi} \times \{ \mat 1\} \\
			\infty & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}$.
	\end{iclaim}
	\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{lproof}
		Writing out the definition explicitly, the first can be written as
		\begin{equation}
			\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = \sum_{j} \left[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j)}{\delta_1} +
				\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_{j,i}}} \right], \label{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}
				% &= \sum_{j} \left[
				% 	\begin{matrix} \mu(C_j\!=\!0) (\infty) \\
				% 	 	+ \mu(C_j \!=\! 1) \log \mu(C_j \!=\! 1)
				% 	\end{matrix} +
				% 	\Ex_{\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X_j)} \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j = \mat x)}{\delta_{\lor_i \mat x_i}} \right],
		\end{equation}
		where $\mat X_j = \{X_{ij} : j \in \mathcal I(j)\}$ is the set of variables that
		appear in clause $j$, and $\delta_{(-)}$ is the probability distribution placing all mass on the point indicated by its subscript.
		As a reminder, the relative entropy is given by
		\[ \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\nu(\Omega)} := \Ex_{\omega \sim \mu} \log \frac{\mu(\omega)}{\nu(\omega)},
		\quad\parbox{1.4in}{\centering and in particular, \\ if $\Omega$ is binary,}\quad
			\kldiv[\big]{\mu(\Omega)}{\delta_\omega} = \begin{cases}
				0 &  \text{if}~\mu(\omega) = 1 ; \\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}.
		\end{cases} \]
		Applying this to \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi}, we find that either:
		\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
			\item Every term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is finite (and zero) so $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$, which happens when $\mu(C_j = 1) = 1$ and $\mu(C_j = \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) = 1$ for all $j$.  In this case, $\mat c = \mat 1 = \{ \vee_i~x_{j,i} \}_j$ so $\mat x \models \varphi$ for every $(\mat{c,x}) \in \supp \mu$;
			\item Some term of \eqref{eqn:explicit-INC-Mvarphi} is infinite, so that $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = \infty$, which happens if some $j$, either

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\mu(C_j \ne 1) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,c}) \in \supp \mu$ with $\mat c \ne 1$, or
				\item $\supp \mu(\mat C) = \{\mat 1\}$, but $\mu(C_j \ne \vee_i~ x_{j,i}) > 0$ --- in which case there is some $(\mat{x,1}) \in \supp \mu$ for which $1 = c_j \ne \vee_i~x_{j,i}\;$, and so $\mat x \not\models \varphi$.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		Condensing and rearranging slightly, we have shown that
		\[
			\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
			\begin{cases}
				0 & \text{if}~  \mat x \models \varphi~\text{and}~\mat c = \mat 1
				 	~\text{for all}~(\mat x, \mat c) \in \supp \mu\\
				\infty & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases}~.
		\]
		% So if $\mat x \models \varphi$ for all $\mat x \in \supp \mu(X)$,
		%
		% $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) = 0$
		% The first term is infinite if $\mu(C_j = 1) < 1$, and the second is infinite
		% if $\mu(C_j = \lor_i X_{i,j}) < 1$. Thus, if $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then $\mat x \sim \mu(\mat X)$ satisfies $\varphi$ with probability 1, and $\varphi$ must be satisfiable.
		% Conversely,
	\end{lproof}

	% Thus, if $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, then every $\mat x \in \supp \mu$ is a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$.
	Because $\SDef_{}$ is bounded, it follows immediately that
 	$\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, is finite if and only if
	there is some distribution $\mu \in \Delta\V(\mat X,\mat C)$ for which $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ is finite, or equivalently, by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, iff there exists some $\mu(\mat X) \in \Delta \V(\mat X)$ for which $\supp \mu(\mat X) \subseteq \bbr{\varphi}$, which in turn is true if and only if $\varphi$ is satisfiable.

	In particular, if $\varphi$ is not satisfiable (i.e., $\#_\varphi = 0$), then $\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma = +\infty$, and
	\[
		\exp \left[ -\frac1\gamma \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma \right] =
	 		\exp [ - \infty ] = 0 = \#_\varphi,
	\]
	so in this case \eqref{eqn:number-of-solns} holds as promised. On the other hand, if $\varphi$ \emph{is} satisfiable, then, again by \Cref{claim:separate-inc-varphi}, every $\mu$ minimizing $\bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma$, (i.e., every $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma^*$) must be supported entirely on $\bbr{\varphi}$ and have $\OInc_{\dg M_\varphi}\!(\mu) = 0$.  As a result, we have
	\[
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma =
			\inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]} \gamma\; \SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) .
	\]
	A priori, by the definition of $\SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}$, we have
	\[
		\SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) =
		 	- \H(\mu) + \sum_{j} \Big[ \alpha_{j,1} \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j)
						+ \alpha_{j,0} \H_\mu(C_j) \Big],
	\]
	where $\alpha_{j,0}$ and $\alpha_{j,1}$ are values of $\alpha$ for the edges of $\dg M_\varphi$, which we have not specified because they are rendered irrelevant by the fact that their corresponding cpds are deterministic. We now show how this plays out in the present case.
	Any $\mu \in \Delta\big[\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big]$ we consider has a degenerate marginal on $\mat C$. Specifcally, for every $j$, we have $\mu(C_j) = \delta_1$, and since entropy is non-negative and never increased by conditioning,
	$$
		0 \le \H_\mu(C_j \mid \mat X_j) \le \H_\mu(C_j) = 0.
	$$
	Therefore, $\SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu)$ reduces to the negative entropy of $\mu$.
	Finally, making use of the fact that the maximum entropy distribution $\mu^*$ supported on a finite set $S$ is the uniform distribution on $S$, and has $\H(\mu^*) = \log | S |$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\aar{\dg M_\varphi}_\gamma &= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)} \gamma\; \SDef_{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) \\
			&= \inf\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)} -\, \gamma\, \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \sup\nolimits_{\mu \in \Delta \big(\bbr{\varphi} \times \{\mat 1\}\big)}  \H(\mu) \\
			&= - \gamma\, \log (\#_\varphi),
	\end{align*}
	\hspace{1in}giving us
	$$
		\#_\varphi = \exp \left[- \frac1\gamma \aar{ \dg M_\varphi }_\gamma \right],
	$$
	as desired. We have now reduced \#SAT to computing $\aar{\dg M}_\gamma$, for $\gamma > 0$ and an arbitrary PDG $\dg M$, which is therefore \#P-hard.

    To show the same for $\gamma = 0$, it suffices to add an additional hyperedge pointing to all variables, and associate it with a joint uniform distribution, and confidence 1, resulting in a new PDG $\dg M_\varphi'$.
    Then, because this new edge's contribution to $\OInc_{\dg M}$
    equals $\kldiv{\mu}{\mathsf{Unif}(\X)} = \log |\V\!\X| - \H(\mu)$,
    we have
    \[
        \bbr{\dg M_\varphi'}_0(\mu)
            = \OInc_{\dg M_\varphi'}(\mu)
            = \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}(\mu) + \log | \V\!\X | - \H(\mu)
            = \bbr{\dg M_\varphi}_{1}(\mu) - \log |\V\!\X |.
    \]
    Since this is true for all $\mu$, we conclude that
    \[
        \aar{\dg M_\varphi'} = \aar{\dg M_\varphi}_1 - \log |\V\!\X| = -\log \big( |\V\!\X|\cdot \#_\varphi \big)
    \]
    so the two differ by a constant, and both compute the number of satisfying assignments to $\varphi$. So in general, computing $\aar{\dg M}$ is \#P-hard as well.
\end{lproof}



\section{INFERENCE VIA INCONSISTENCY MINIMIZATION}
    \label{sec:inf-via-inc}

\textbf{(extra definitions)}
    
One selling point of PDGs is their modularity:
 if $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$ are two PDGs, we can take the dusjoint union of their arcs (and associated data) to get a new PDG, denoted $\dg M_1 + \dg M_2$,
which represents the combined information of both $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$.

For the purposes of adding data to PDGs in this way, we implicitly convert cpds to singleton PDGs that have default weight $\beta = 1$.



\TODO[TODO: rewrite this assuming that the entire main paper is in scope, rather than
    as an alternate introduction to inference of PDGs]

We are now equipped to talk more technically about inference in PDGs.
% When working with traditional graphical models, the meaning is clear.
%k
Since PDG semantics are already given in terms of a scoring function,
% the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it.
the obvious thing to do is to find a distribution that minimizes it.
%joe2*: But what does this minimization have to do with the inference
%problem you defined above?
%oli2*: if you have a concrete joint distribution, computing marginal probabilities of it is trivial, and conditioning is not much harder. Did my additions help?
Such a distribution $\mu$ could straightforwardly be used to answer probabilistic queries \eqref{q:inf} and compute inconsistency.
% There are several immediate difficulties.
There are some immediate difficulties with this approach.

% There are some obstacles to this.


\begin{enumerate}[nosep, label=\textbf{D\arabic*.}]
    \item Even writing down a distribution $\mu$, let alone evaluating its score $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma (\mu)$, or minimizing it, takes exponential time.

    \item Generally speaking, optimization is computationally difficult.
        Even our most powerful optimization techniques only provably find optima in certain special cases.
    Unfortunately, while standard optimization techniques seem to work in practice
%joe1: why don't the standard tools apply in our setting?
%oli1: the next sentence explains it: the standard tools require Lipshitz-ness or
% self-concordance. How can I write this more clearly, if I don't really want to go into
% either but still want to mention the names so that people know what doesn't work?
%  (actually, the way the optimizer works is by using a self-concordant barrier function,
%       which is realted, but we can't use self-concordance directly in the obvious way.)
%
%      (more-or-less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      (more or less; see \cref{sec:expts}), the standard theoretical
      tools do not apply in our setting.
        % and even if it can be
%joe2*: What does it even mean for a pdg to be strictly convex?
%oli2*: The scoring function is convex, in its argument $\mu$. Is this unclear from the wording? [[M]]_\gamma is the scoring function.
%oli2: adding wording to try to abdicate responsibility for motivation
        % Despite being strictly convex,
        To be technical: despite being strictly convex,
        %oli2: removing because I have too many duplicate citations.
        % \parencite[at least for small $\gamma$,][]{pdg-aaai},
        and even $C^\infty$ smooth,
%joe1: I have no idea what self-concordant means.  Unless you're sure
%that over 90% of AIStats folks will now, you must define it and
%explain why it's relevant.  At least I know what the Lipshitz
%condition is, but it couldn't hurt to explain that too.
%joe2*: You still need to explain these terms and MOTIVATE why we care
%about them.
%oli2: I don't really. I want this to be a passing remark for those who know about self-concordance (which I'd guess is 40% of AISTATS folks) and Lipshitz-ness (I'd guess > 95% of AISTATS), but I really don't wan't to make a big deal of either of these two things. They're not important to me, they're just the standard tools that I don't think work. What do you think I should do?
        in general $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ seems to be neither Lipshitz nor self-concordant.
         % convex (in $\mu$, which is exponentially large),
    \item Even if we coulld easily find optimizers of the function $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ for fixed $\gamma > 0$, it's still not obvious that this would allow us to calculate the unique limiting distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*$.
\end{enumerate}

We will ultimately address each of these issues, but before we do so,
% let's start with a shift in perspective.
let's start by trying to do inference as
suggested in the final section of \textcite{pdg-aaai}, which meshes well with
the persepctive taken in \textcite{one-true-loss}.

%joe2*: As I said, this should already be in the intro
%oli2*: As I responded below with %oli1, I disagree because it doesn't pan out;
% it's just an interesting perspective. I think this is the right place for it.
The argument there is that one can do modeling as follows:
    represent all of the relevant information as cpds,
    form a PDG out of them, and
%joe2*: I'm lost.  What knobs do we have?  This comes out of the blue.
%oli2: in this case, just $p(Y|X)$, but I was trying to reerence the general approach
% of my first AISTATS paper, not talk about this in particular. I've done a minor
% tweak to the wording to try to make this clear.
    % play with the knobs you have to to minimize the resulting inconsistency.
    play with whatever knobs are available, so as to minimize the overall inconsistency.
% Well, we have a PDG $\dg M$, and we also have a candidate joint distribution $\mu$.
% What if we put them both on the same footing, in a new PDG, and measure its inconsistency?
%joe1
%It is not hard to show that the distribution any distribution $\mu$
%that minimizes this quantity must also satisfy $\mu \in \bbr{\dg
% It is not hard to show that any distribution
% that minimizes this quantity must be in $\bbr{\dg
  % M}_\gamma^*$. More generally,
Well, we have a PDG $\dg M$, and we wanted to know the probablility of $Y$ given $X$.
What happens if we extend $\dg M$ with a guess, say $p(Y|X)$, and then

As hinted in \textcite{pdg-aaai},
this
%oli2: modified
% would indeed perform our inference task,
would indeed suffice for inference,
%oli2: also added
since the optimal value of $p(Y|X)$ would be the cpd we wanted.

%joe2*: What does this proposition have to  say about the inference
%task you defined earlier.  A priori, it doesn't look that closely related.
%oli2: did my additions above help?

%joe1*: The claim that we can use inconsistency to compute the

%
%oli1: If this was what gave the reason we don't discuss it in the introduction
Consequently, if we are interested only in querying the marginal probability of some small subset $Y$ of variables conditioned on other ones $X$ (i.e., the usual form of a query to a graphical model), and we had an efficient way to estimate the inconsistency of a guess $p(Y|X)$ with the rest of the model, we would have successfully cleared obstacle \textbf{D1}.

%oli2: smoothness and strict convexity means gradient descent with

% It fits into the story because functions with these properties are relatively easy to
% optimize. At the outset, we know inference is hard. We can ask ourselves: is it the

\TODO[TODO: merge the presentation below in, which is essentially a more refined version of the above.]

If $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$ are two PDGs, we can take the dusjoint union of their arcs (and associated data) to get a new PDG, denoted $\dg M_1 + \dg M_2$,
which represents the combined information of both $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$.

What does inference mean in a PDG?
How ought we to respond to a probabilistic query $Q(Y|X{=}x)$?
The answer is not so obvious as it is for other graphical models,
for several different reasons.

\textbf{1.}
% First,
PDGs describe inconsistent beleifs,
so why should we expect to get consistent answers by querying them?
% If the inconsistency were sorted out, then arguably there is no need for a PDG; one may use a probability distribution, or a compressed representation of one (such as a different graphical model) instead.
% Were we able to sort out the inconsistency,
% there is a case to be made that
Even for BNs, we often use algorithms that give inconsistent answers to queries, and BNs very clearly represent a single distribution.
%
% To illustrate one aspect of this,
% A BN may already contain answers to the querie
% Consider a BN in which $X$ is the set of parents of $Y$.
% In this case, our representation already contains the probabilities we are looking for, and we would be happy returning that row of the table.
% Such a BN has a row of a table that represents $\Pr(Y|X{=}x)$, which is the answer we are looking for.
In a BN, we might get lucky and find a row of a cpd that represents $\Pr(Y|X{=}x)$, which would be the answer we're looking for.
% and it would be reasonable to short-circuit an inference procedure upon finding it.
% But in a PDG, that same  $p(Y | X)$ may not even be the only conditional probability on $Y$ given $X$, let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
% But in a PDG, that very same row  $p(Y | X{=}x)$ of the same table may not even be the only  let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.
But in a PDG, that same row  $p(Y | X{=}x)$ might not even be the only probability of $Y$ given $X{=}x$, let alone the same as $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X)$.

\textbf{2.}
% \textbf{Conditioning.}
% Secondly,
% Here's a property of PDGs that is not shared by other graphical models:
% Unlike other graphical models,
% Unlike for other graphical models,
% there is a
% PDGs draw a distinction between constraining so that $X{=}x$,
% and  distribution.
In sharp contrast to other graphical models \parencite[pg 26]{koller2009probabilistic},
the PDG formalism draws a distinction between
% computing the distribution of $Y$ under the constraint $X{=}x$,
the posterior distribution of $Y$ after learning that $X{=}x$,
and computing the distribution of $Y$ given $X{=}x$, conditioned in the usual way.

\begin{example}
	Consider a PDG $\dg M$ containing $p(Y)$ with confidence
    $\beta_p = r$, and $q(X|Y)$ with confidence $\beta_q = s$.
	% Now condition on $Y=y$ by adding that event to the PDG, to get
    Now, add the event $X{=}x$ to $\dg M$, to obtain
    % a new PDG:
    a new PDG, $\dg M^{+x}$.
	% \[
	% 	\dg M^{+y} :=
	% 	\begin{tikzpicture}[center base]
	% 		\node[dpad0] (X) at (0,0) {$X$};
	% 		\node[dpad0] (Y) at (1.2,0) {$Y$};
    %         %
	% 		\draw[arr2,->] (X) to
	% 			node[above, pos=0.4,inner sep=2pt]{$q$}
	% 			node[below, pos=0.4, inner sep=2pt]{${\color{gray}\scriptstyle(s)}$}
	% 			(Y);
	% 		\draw[arr2, <-] (X) to
	% 			node[above, pos=0.6,inner sep=2pt]{$p$}
	% 			node[below, pos=0.6, inner sep=2pt]
	% 				{${\color{gray}\scriptstyle(r)}$}
	% 			+(-1.0, 0);
	% 		\draw[arr2, <<-, red] (Y) to
	% 			node[above, inner sep=2pt, pos=0.7]
	% 				{$y$}
	% 			+(0.9,0);
	% 	\end{tikzpicture}.
	% \]
	Now, $\bbr{\dg M}^* = p(Y)q(X|Y)$ doesn't depend on $r$ or $s$, since we can simultaneously satisfy $p$ and $q$---and after conditioning on $X{=}x$, we get a distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^* | X{=}x$ proportional to $p(Y) q(x|Y)$.
	But some calculations reveal that $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^*$,
    while also supported only on worlds where $X{=}x$, is proportional to
	$p(Y) q(x|Y)^{s/r}$.
    % , with an additional exponent $r/s$ that was not present before.
	%
	So if $r = s$,
    % so that the data of $\dg M$ effectively picks out a probability distribution with uniform confidence,
    this amounts to conditioning as usual, but otherwise,
    it doesn't.
    % there is distortion.
    % we don't.
    % Intuitively, the cpd with lower confidence ends
    Intuitively, both the distribution of $Y$ and the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y$ can be bent to satisfy $X{=}x$, and in $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^*$ the cpd with lower confidence will be bent further than the one of higher confidence.
    If $r \gg s$ for example,
    % then the resulting distribution will just be
    then $\bbr{\dg M^{+x}}^* \approx
    % p(X)\delta_{y}(Y)$.
    p(Y) \delta_x(X)$.
    And perhaps that is even a better answer than conditioning, if indeed we are far more confident in $p$ than in $q$.
\end{example}

So, adding an event to a PDG is a different kind of conditioning,
which is sensitive to confidence.  This has big implications for responding to conditional probability queries, because it means there can be a big difference between restricting to worlds where $Y{=}y$, as is typically done, and conditioning on $Y{=}y$.
Because both notions are defensible,
we start with the uncontroversial, simpler version: solving the marginal inference task.
% So as not to privelidge either notion over the other,
% we define PDG inference to be the marginal task.
% Both notions are defensible, but to put them on the same footing.


% By inference in a PDG, we mean respoding to probabilisty qureies $Q(Y|X)$ for (sets of) variables $X,Y \subset \X$
\begin{defn}
    A \emph{marginal PDG inference algorithm} is a procedure
    that takes as input
    % (1)
    a PDG $\dg M$ over variables $\X$,
    % a non-negative number $\gamma \ge 0$ or $0^+$,
    % either a non-negative number $\gamma \ge 0$ or $\gamma = $``$0^+$'',
    % (2)
    a value for $\gamma \in \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \cup \{0^+\}$,
    and
    % (3)
    % a probabilistic query of the form $Q(Y|X{=}x)$,
    a set of variables $Y \subset \X$,
    % for $X,Y \subset \X$ and $x \in \V X$,
    % returns a probability distribution $\mu(Y)$ that is the conditional marginal
    % and then returns either a distribution $\mu(Y|X{=}x)$
    and then returns either a distribution $\mu(Y)$
    which is the
    % conditional
    marginal
    of some $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$  (if $\gamma$ is a number),
    % or $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y|X{=}x)$ (if $\gamma = 0^+$).
    or $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y)$ (if $\gamma = 0^+$).
\end{defn}

We can use such marginal inference algorithm
to respond to \emph{conditional} probabilistic queries
% about of $Y$ given $X{=}x$
$Q(Y|X{=}x)$ in both ways.
% in at least two ways:
% one can run
% $\mathit{MInfer}$
On one hand, we can query the marginal distribution of $Y$ in $\dg M + (X{=}x)$
to get this new kind of conditioning;
% $\bbr{\dg M + X{=}x}_\gamma^*(Y) =
% $\mathit{InferMarg}_\gamma(Y | \dg M + (X{=}x) )$.
% That is, first adding the event $X{=}x$ to the PDG.
%
% This procedure can also be used to answer the question in the same way as for other graphical models with minimal overhead.
% Another way
% First, if $X$ is a small set of variables, then we can compute both the marginal $\mu(X,Y)$ and the marginal $\mu(X)$ and compute $\mu(Y|X{=}x)$ directly.
% Alternatively,
% Furthermore,
% On the other hand,
% it will $\mu^*(Y|X{=}x)$
on the other,
each method we present can be augmented with a standard post-procesing step
to compute the usual conditional probability $\mu^*(Y|X{=}x)$.
% can be computed with some post-processing.
% to a conditional probability query amounts to a standard postprocessing step,
% which does not significantly impact the complexity of the algorithm.

\subsection{}
\label{sec:example-gamma}
For example, consider a PDG $\dg M$ containing three hyperarcs
$
    \Ar = \{ \ed0XY, \quad \ed{1}{}{X}, \quad \ed2{}Y  \}.
$
% which are associated, respectively, with probabilities $p_1(X), p_2(Y)$, and $p_3(Y|X)$. 
Suppose that the first two contain only structural information, 
while the last contains only observational information. 
Formally, this means that we have $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 1$ while $\alpha_0 = 0$;
and also $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$ (so it doesn't matter what $p_1(X)$ or $p_2(Y)$ are), while $\beta_0 > 0$ and $p_0(Y|X)$ is some conditional distribution on $Y$ given $X$. 

The structure of this PDG asserts that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.
But unless $p_0(Y|X)$ gives the same distribution on $Y$ for every value of $X$, the structural and observational information in this PDG appear to be inconsistent.
This is not quite true, because $X$ might be deterministic, making it independent of $Y$ no matter what. 
In this case, for all $\gamma > 0$ and also in the observational limit, 
$\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$ consists of all disitributions $\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X)p_0(Y|X)$ in which
$p_0(Y|x)$ is identical for all $x$ in the support of $\mu(X)$.

Note that there was no \obslimit\ here, which is possible 
because the condition $\bbeta > 0$ was not met.  Let's tweak the problem slightly, 
and suppose that $\beta_1 > 0$.

Now on the one extreme, we now have an \obslimit\
\[
    \bbr{\dg M}^*_{\epsilon} = p_1(X) p_0(Y|X)
\]
since the observational information alone is enough to determine a unique distribution.
At the other extreme, as $\gamma \to \infty$, the PDG represents those distributions 
in which $\mu(X)$ and $\mu(Y)$ are independent, but come closest to matching.
If, in addition, we assume $\beta_0 = \beta_1$, then we can conclude that
\[
    \bbr{\dg M}^*_{\nf1\epsilon} = p_1(X) p_0(Y) 
\]
where $p_0(Y) := \Ex_{x \sim p_1}[ p_0(Y|x) ]$.


\section{LARGER
    \texorpdfstring{$\boldsymbol\gamma$}{GAMMA} AND THE CONVEX-CONCAVE PROCEDURE}
    \label{sec:larger-gamma}

% Now, suppose we're no longer
Next, let's consider the case where $\gamma$ is
larger, meaning that the structural term $(\SDef_{})$,
becomes more important.
Because $\SDef_{}$ can express features of a distribution like conditional indepenedence,
it cannot be convex.%
    \footnote{one can easily verify that set of distributions that make $X$ and $Y$ independent is not convex.}
Nevertheless, \eqref{eq:altscore} still gives us a way to proceed because it is a decomposition into a sum of a convex and a concave function, meaning that we can apply the convex-concave procedure, or CCCP \parencite{yuille2003concave}.
% The first line is the sum of a linear term and a convex one,
In more detail: and each individual term on the second line is either convex or concave, depending on the sign of the quantity $\gamma \alpha\ssub L - \beta\ssub L$.
Once we sort the terms into convex terms $f(\mu)$ and strictly concave terms $g(\mu)$, we can choose an initial guess $\mu_0$, and iteratively use the convex solver as in \cref{sec:small-gamma} to compute
%
\begin{align*}
    \mu_{t+1} &:= \argmin_{\mu} f(\mu) + (\mu - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}
        \nabla g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}

As we will see, the aproach presented here section is
not very fast, but it is guaranteed to make progress, since
\def\tplus1{{t\mskip-2mu+\mskip-2mu1}}
\begin{align*}
    f(\mu_\tplus1) \!+\! g(\mu_\tplus1) &<  f(\mu_\tplus1) \!+\! (\mu_\tplus1 \!-\! \mu_t)^{\sf T} \nabla g(\mu_t) \!+\! g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(concavity of $g$)}
        \\
    &\le  f(\mu_t) + (\mu_t - \mu_{t})^{\sf T}\nabla g(\mu_t)  + g(\mu_t)
        % &\text{(defn of argmin)}
    \\
&= f(\mu_t) + g(\mu_t)
\end{align*}
and eventually find an optimum, because the concave terms are bounded (since they are conditional entropies of a finitely supported distribution).

    Inference in a PDG---that is, computing conditional marginals of $\bbr{\dg M}^*$---%
    and the computing inconsistency $\aar{\dg M}$ are equally difficult:
