\begin{abstract}
    We provide the first tractable inference algorithm for Probabilistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs) with discrete variables, thereby placing PDGs on asymptotically similar footing as other graphical models, such as Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs.
    This may be surprising, because PDGs are much more expressive than these other models, and also because a PDG inference algorithm can be used 
    % for ``inconsistency minimization'', 
    % which has been argued to be widely useful. 
    to resolve inconsistencies, which has been proposed as a generic modeling task. 
    
    The key to our approach is combining 
    (1) our finding that inference in PDGs with bounded tree-width can be reduced to a tractable linear optimization problem with exponential cone constraints,
    with (2) a recent interior point method that can (provably) solve such problems efficiently (Dahl \& Anderson, 2022).
    We provide a concrete implementation and emperical evaluation.
    In addition, we prove auxiliary results about complexity of this problem, and discuss other approaches to it.

% %%-----------    A FRANK SUMMARY    ---------------
% Measuring / Estimating /  Inconsistency is very useful.
% For instance, (1) propogating it backwards through layers of computation = differentiable learning. 
% 
% Certain localized versions of it can be used to do other algorithms.

% How hard is it? 
% With interior point methods (convex programs with exponential cone constraints) we can do it in $O(n^4 \log n)$ time \& space, worst case for exact inference. So far, this means slightly harder than inference in Graphical models.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

% How expensive 
% This paper provides some partial answers to the 
How difficult is it to estimate how inconsistent your beliefs are?
How difficult is it to best sort through these inconsistencies? 
This paper formalizes and partially answers to these questions.

Probabilistic Dependency Graphs, or pdgs \parencite{pdg-aaai},
are a particularly flexible class of probabilistic graphical models, which subsumes Bayesian Networks and Factor Graphs.
The primary force behind the expressiveness of pdgs is their ability to capture inconsistent beliefs and measure the degree of this inconsistency.
%
Beyond its role in undergirding the semantics of pdgs, 
this measurement of inconsistency

Diagrammatic Calculus.
All of this paints a story 

But what use is a model without an inference algorithm? 
We analyze the complexity of inference and updating in pdgs, and 
provide an efficient algorithm and exponenital cones.
We then lean heavily on recent work 
\parencite{dahl2022primal} showing that 
such problems can be 

In practice, we find that our algorithms are not as fast as exact inference methods for existing graphical models, such as beleif propogation.   
However, their asymptotics are not much worse.

\section{PRELIMINARIES}

\textbf{Basic notation.}
% This paper concerns the 
Let $\mat 1$ denote the all-ones vector.
Tensor product

We write $\Delta S$ to denote the set of proability distributions over a finite set $S$.
Every variable $X$ can take on a finite set $\V(X)$ of possible values. 
% If $S$ is a finite set, we write $\Delta S$ for the set of probability distributions over $S$, i.e., the simplex over its elements. 
A conditional probability distribution (cpd) $p(Y|X)$ is a map 
$p : \V(X) \to \Delta \V(Y)$, so it assigns, to every $x \in \V(X)$, a probability distribution $p(Y|x) \in \Delta Y$, which is shorthand for $p(Y|X\!\!=\!x)$.
Given a joint distribution $\mu$ over many variables including both $X$ and $Y$, 
we write $\mu(X)$ for its marginal distribution on $X$, and $\mu(Y|X)$ for the cpd obtained by first conditioning on $X$ and then marginalizing to $Y$. 


\textbf{Probabilistic Dependency Graphs.}
% \textbf{PDGs.}
We now give a quick overview of the PDG formalism,
following the more carefully motivated
expositions of \textcite{pdg-aaai,one-true-loss}.
%
% Let $\N$ be a set of variables, and 
%
% Fix a set $\N$ of variables. 
A probabilistic dependency graph (pdg) is just a collection of cpds, weighted by two kinds of confidence. More precisely:

\begin{defn}
    a pdg $\dg M
     % = (\mathcal P, \balpha, \bbeta)$ 
    $
    over $\N$ is a set $\Ed$ of edges, 
    each $L \in \Ed$ of which is associated with:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item (subsets of) variables $\Src L, \Tgt L \subset \N$, indicating the respective source and target variables of the edge;
        \item a cpd $p\ssub L (\Tgt L | \Src L)$ on the target variables given the source variables,
        \item a weight $\beta\ssub L \in \Rext$ indicating 
            the modeler's confidence in the cpd $p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L)$, and 
        \item a weight $\alpha\ssub L \in \mathbb R$ indicating 
            the modeler's confidence that the edge $L$ corresponds to an independent mechanism that determines $\Tgt L$ given $\Src L$. 
        \qedhere
    %     % \item $\mathcal P = \{ p\ssub L (\mat T_L | \mat S_L) \}_{L \in \Ed}$ is an indexed set of cpds   
    %     \item $\bbeta$ 
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

The incompatibility of a joint distribution $\mu(\N)$ over all variables, with such a PDG is given by a weighted sum of relative entropies:
\begin{align*}
    \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) :=
        \sum_{L \in \Ed} \beta\ssub L\, \kldiv[\Big]{\mu(\Tgt L,\Src L)}{p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L) \mu(\Src L)}.
        % \Ex_{\mu} \sum_{L \in \Ed} \beta\ssub L 
        %     \log \frac{\mu(\Tgt_L \mid \Src_L)}{p\ssub L(\Tgt_L \mid \Src_L)}
\end{align*}
$\Inc$ is called the ``quantitative'' term because it measures $\mu$'s discrepency
with the quantitative data in the cpds. 
Meanwhile, there is also a ``qualitative'' term, called the \emph{information deficiency}, given by
% \begin{align*}
$
    \IDef{\dg M}(\mu) := - \H(\mu) + \sum_{L \in \Ed} \alpha\ssub L\, \H_\mu(\Tgt L | \Src L).
$.
Although we won't motivate it here, note that $\IDef{}$ does not depend on the cpds (``quantitative beliefs'') of $\dg M$, nor even the possible values of the variables---it is defined purely in terms of the topology of the graph and the weights $\balpha$. 
% \end{align*}
The PDG semantics are then given by a scoring fuction: 
$\bbr{\dg M}: \Delta \V\N \to \Rext$
the linear combination
\begin{align*}
    \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) &:= \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) + \gamma \IDef{\dg M}(\mu) 
        \\&= \EX_{\mu}\left[\, \sum_{L \in \Ed} \log \frac
            {\mu(\Tgt L| \Src L)^{\beta\ssub L - \gamma \alpha \ssub L}}
            {p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L)^{\beta \ssub L}}
        \right] - \gamma \H(\mu)
        .
\end{align*}

The notation $\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma := \argmin_\mu \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu)$ denotes the set of optimal distributions at a particular $\gamma$.
Of particular interest is the ``quantitative limit'' as $\gamma \to 0$, 
in which there is a unique optimal joint distribution, $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, which achieves the smallest information deficiency among those distributions maximally compatible with $\dg M$. 

The inconsistency of a PDG $\dg M$ is the smallest possible score of any distribution:
\begin{align*}
    \aar{\dg M}_\gamma := \inf_{\mu \in \Delta\!\V\!\N}\, \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu).
\end{align*}
To parallel 

\textbf{Exponential Cones.}
The exponential cone is the convex set
\begin{align*}
    K_{\mskip-1mu\exp} &:=\!\!\!\!\!\!
        \begin{aligned}
        \big\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) &: 
                x_1 \ge x_2 e^{x_3 / x_2},\, x_2 > 0 \big\} 
        \\\quad \mathbin{\cup}\, \big\{ (x_1, 0, x_3) &: x_1 \ge 0,\, x_3 \le 0 \big\} 
    \end{aligned}
    \subset \mathbb R^3.
\end{align*}

\section{REDUCTION TO A LINEAR PROGRAM WITH EXPONENTIAL CONE CONSTRAINTS}

We now present the central finding of our paper: formalizing the critical observation that the PDG objective $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ can be written
as a linear optimization problem with exponential cone constraints.

We will proceed as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item
    illustrate how to find the minimizers of $\Inc$, in a simple setting with only one variable and no conditional distributions.
    \item
    show how the same approach can be generalized to find minimizers of $\Inc$ in general PDGs,
    \item \label{item:+idef}
    show how to find $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, the unique distribution specified by $\dg M$ in the quantitative limit.
    
    \item \label{item:cccp}
    employ the convex-concave procedure 
    \parencite{yuille2003concave}, to find some minimizer $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$ (although it may not be unique), for fixed $\gamma > 0$.
        
    \item 
    Finally, show how \cref{item:+idef,item:cccp} can also be achieved 
    with a more efficient compact representation of a distribution, for PDGs that have
    bounded tree-width.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{}\label{sec:illust}

To illustrate the idea, consider the special case in which our PDG contains only one variable $X$, which takes values $\V(X) = \{1, \ldots, n\}$. 
Suppose further that for every edge $j \in \Ed = \{1, \ldots, m\}$, the cpd $p_j(X)$ is an unconditional dsitribution over $X$. 
    % i.e., $\Tgt k = X$, and $\Src k = \emptyset$.
% Such unconditional probabilities may be identified with unit vectors $\mat p\ssub L \in \mathbb R^n$.  Similarly a candidate (``joint'') distribution $\mu(X)$
Such unconditional probabilities may be identified with unit vectors $\mat p_j \in \mathbb R^n$, and all $m$ of them may stacked together to form a stochastic matrix $\mat P = [\,p_{ij}] \in [0,1]^{n \times m}$.
Of course, a candidate (``joint'') distribution $\mu(X)$
may be represented as a unit vector $\mat m \in \mathbb R^n$. 
%
% Now, consider another collection of vectors $\{\mat t\ssub {\,L}\,\in \mathbb R^n\}_{L \in \Ed}$ and notice that:
% \begin{align*}
%     \forall  L &\in \Ed.~~ 
%     (-\mat t\ssub L\,, \mat m, \mat p\ssub L) \in K_{\exp}^n \\
%         &\iff 
%             \forall  L \in \Ed.~~
%             \mat t \succeq {\mat m} \log \frac{\mat m}{\mat p}
%         \\&\implies \sum_{L \in \Ed}\sum_{i=1}^n t_i  \ge \kldiv{\mat m}{\mat p}
% \end{align*}
Now consider a matrix $\mat T = [t_{ij}] \in \Rext^{n \times m}$,
and observe that:
\begin{align*}
    &(- \mat T,~ \mat m \otimes \mat 1,~ \mat P) \in K_{\exp}^{n \times m} \\
    &\iff \forall  i,j \in [n]\!\times\![m].~~ 
        (- t_{ij}, m_{i}, p_{ij}) \in K_{\exp} \\
    &\iff \forall  i,j \in [n]\!\times\![m].~~ 
            t_{ij} \ge m_i \log \frac{m_i}{p_{ij}} \\
    &\implies \forall j \in [n].~~  {\textstyle\sum_i} t_{ij}  \ge \kldiv{\mu}{p_j} \\
    &\implies \sum_{i,j} \beta_j t_{ij}  \ge \beta_j \kldiv{\mu}{p_j} \\
    &\iff \mat 1^{\sf T} \mat T \bbeta \ge \Inc(\mu)
    .
    % &\implies \sum_{L \in \Ed}\sum_{i=1}^n t_i  \ge \kldiv{\mat m}{\mat p}
\end{align*}

So now, if $(\mat T, \mat m)$ are a solution to the convex program
\[
    % \mathop{\text{minimize}}
    \min
    \limits_{\mat m, \mat T}~~
        \mat 1^{\sf T} \mat T \bbeta 
    \quad\text{subject to}\quad 
    \begin{cases}
        (-\mat T, \mat m\otimes \mat 1,\, \mat P) \in K_{\exp}^{n \times m} \\
        \mat 1^{\sf T} \mat m  = 1
    \end{cases},
\]
then (1) the inconsistency $\aar{\dg M} = \mat 1^{\sf T} \mat T \bbeta$ equals the optimal objective value, and 
(2) $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}^*_0$ is maximally compatible with $\mu$. 
% This illustrates the general principle, but 

\subsection{Adding More Variables, Conditionals, Marginals}

% Having seen some of the details of the maxtrix computations, let's now move up a level, and make the identifications between distributions and vectors implicitly. 
% For example, we will implicitly identify a joint distribution $\mu$ 
% with the appropriate vector 
Now, let's consider the general case of a pdg 
$\dg M = (\N, \Ed, \mathcal P, \balpha, \bbeta)$.
For each $L \in \Ed$, let $N_L := |\V(\Src L, \Tgt L)|$ be the dimension of joint settings of the source and target values of $L$, i.e., the dimension of the cpd $p \ssub L$.

Let $K := \sum_{L \in \Ed} N_L$ be the total dimension
of all of the condtional probabilities in $\dg M$.

Let $t = (t^L)_{L \in \Ed} \in \Rext^{K}$.
let $\Pi_{X}$ be the projection map that marginalizes to the variables $X$. 

Consider the problem

\begin{align*}
    % \min_{\mu, t} &\qquad
    \min_{\mat m, \mat t} &\qquad
        % \Vert t \Vert_1  
        \sum_{L}\beta_L | t^L |
    \\
    \text{subject to}&\qquad
        % (-t^L, \mu(\Src L, \Tgt L), \mu(\Src L) p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L)) 
        % (-t^L, \Pi_{(\Src L \Tgt L)}\mu, \Pi_{(\Src L)} (\mu) p\ssub L(\Tgt L | \Src L)) 
        (-t^L,~ \Pi_{\Src L\!\Tgt L}\mat m,~
            \mat P\!\ssub L \Pi_{\Src L} \mat m ) 
        % (-t^L_{xy}, \mu(x,y), )
            \in K_{\exp},\\
        &\qquad 
            % \mu \ge 0, ~~ | \mu | = 1.
            \mat m \ge 0, ~~ | \mat m | = 1.
            \numberthis\label{eq:joint-prob}
\end{align*}

% This convex program has $K+1$ constraints 
\TODO[ Should we convert this to a different form? 
    The fact that you can even write constraints this way hinges on the fact 
    that it's still a diciplined convex program to enforce exponential cone constraints
    on affine transformations of the program variables. ]

Logic similar to that in \cref{sec:illust} gives yields: 
\begin{prop}
    If $(\mu, t)$ are a solution to \eqref{eq:joint-prob}, then
    $\mu \in \bbr{\dg M}_0^*$,
    % i.e., is maximally compatible with $\dg M$, and
    and
    $\sum_{L}\beta_L |t^L| = \aar{\dg M}$.
\end{prop}


\subsection{Incorporating IDef}

% To do this second pass, we will need this second property
% As $\gamma \to 0$, the limit of $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$

So far, we have only found a distribution

\begin{prop}\label{prop:marginonly}
	For any PDG $\dg M$, 
	the highest-compatibility distributions (the minimizers $\bbr{\dg M}_0^*$ of $\Inc_{\dg M}$) all have the same conditional probabilities along the edges of $\dg M$.   
	That is to say, if there is an edge $\ed LXY \in \Ed^{\dg M}$, and $\mu_1, \mu_2 \in \bbr{\dg M}_0^*$ are quantitatively optimal distributions, then $\mu_1(Y|X) = \mu_2(Y|X)$.  
\end{prop}

As a result, 

\subsection{The Convex-Concave Procedure}

% \footnote{Indeed, $K_{\exp}$ is sometimes called the ``relative entropy cone'' for this reason.} 


% \subsection{Tree Deomposition
\subsection{A Polynomial Algorithm for the Case of Bounded Tree-Width}
The first property that makes this possible is 

\begin{linked}[Markov Property for PDGs]{prop}{markov-property}
	% Suppose $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$ are compatible PDGs, and let $\mathbf X$ denote the variables they have in common.
	% Then for all $\gamma > 0$, we have that
	% \[
	%  	\bbr{\dg M_1 \bundle \dg M_2}^*_\gamma
	% 		% \subset
	% 		~\models~
	% 	% \mathrm I( \N_1 ; \N_2 \mid \mathbf X)
	% 	\N_1 \mathbin{\bot\!\!\!\bot} \N_2 \mid \mat X
	% \]
	% That is: in every optimizing distribution, for any value of $\gamma$, the variables of $\dg M_1$ and the variables of $\dg M_2$ are conditionally independent given their shared variables $\mat X$.
	% Suppose $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$ are value-compatible PDGs,
	% with respective sets of nodes $\mat X_1 := \N^{\dg M_1}$ and
	% $\mat X_2 := \N^{\dg M_2}$.
	Suppose $\dg M_1$ and $\dg M_2$, over respective sets of variables $\mat X_1$ and $\mat X_2$.
	 % and let $\mathbf X$ denote the variables they have in common.
	Then for all $\gamma > 0$, we have that
	\[
	 	\bbr{\dg M_1 \bundle \dg M_2}^*_\gamma
			% \subset
			~\models~
		% \mathrm I( \N_1 ; \N_2 \mid \mathbf X)
		% \N_1 \mathbin{\bot\!\!\!\bot} \N_2 \mid \mat X
		% \N^{\dg M_1} \mathbin{\bot\!\!\!\bot} \N^{\dg M_2} \mid \mat X
		\mat X_1 \mathbin{\bot\!\!\!\bot} \mat X_2 \mid \mat X_1 \cap \mat X_2
	\]
	That is, in every optimal distribution $\mu^* \in \bbr{\dg M_1 \bundle \dg M_2}^*_\gamma$ for some $\gamma>0$, the variables of $\dg M_1$ and the variables of $\dg M_2$ are conditionally independent given the variables they have in common.
\end{linked}

One consequence of \cref{prop:markov-property} is that every distribution that a PDG
can pick out, for any $\gamma$ and also in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$, can also be described as a factor graph with the same structure as that PDG.
How do we square this with the \citeauthor{pdg-aaai}'s claim that PDGs are more general than factor graphs?





% This may be surprising, given how \citeauthor{pdg-aaai} position their model as strictly more expressive than other graphical models, because it implies that the optimal distribution
