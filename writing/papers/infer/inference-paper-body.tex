\section{Introduction}

% {\color{gray}
% Suppose that we have a collection of probabilistic beliefs.
% How can we tell if they are self-consistent?
% How difficult is it to measure how inconsistent they are?
% How much computation is necessary to synthesize our beliefs into a single joint probability distribution?
% This paper provides answers---both
% theoretical and practical---to these questions. }
%joe3*: While these are interesting questions, they are not the
%standard questions tyhat have been asked when it comes to inference.
%since no other approach can capture inconsistency well, no one has
%asked the question of how inconsistent beliefs are (to the best of my
%knowledge). Moreover, the notion of inconsistency you're dealing
%with is an idiosyncratic notion, that you tailored to PDGs.   That
%means the leadoff paragraph does not situate this work well in the
%ocntext of what's been done.  It may be better to start with
%inference (what you denote as (Q)) and then move to inconsistency,
%rather than the other way around, as you've done.  I think that would
%make the story read better.

%joe1: much too wordy
%The primary force behind the expressiveness of pdgs is their ability
%to capture inconsistent beliefs, and the natural way of measuring the
%degree of this inconsistency that the formalism provides.
%joe4
%Unlike the models they generalize,
% PDGs can capture inconsistent beliefs, and have an associated measure
%joe4: a PDG doesn't "have probabilities", and I don't know what it
%means for a PDG to be being self-consistent.
%oli4: I don't get this comment. Obviously it has probabilities. A PDG is a collection of (conditional) probabilites (that aren't all over the same variable, or conditioned on the same events). That is, the most general container for probabilistic information.
%oli4: your rewrite (below) isn't talking about the same thign I am. What you're talking about is what we call ``incompatibility'', not inconsistency. The inconsistency is the more important notion.
%| of inconsistency that quantifies how far a probability measure is from
%| satisfying the constraints of the PDG.
%oli4: ^ I also don't like calling the conditional probabilities "constraints", for a couple of reasons: (1) as a modeling tool, I want people to just articulate all of the probailistic beliefs they have on hand, and the term "constraint" suggests particular flavor or strength of belief; (2) we expect that typicallly all of the constraints will be violated.
%oli4: How is this for a compromise, that doesn't include "self-consistency"?
%joe5: A PDG doesn't "contain" belief
%oli5: what? it does; it's litterally a container for conditional probability distributions which are interpreted as beliefs. Your wording may be better, but I don't understand your objection to this at all.
%joe6: My objection is to the English.  We don't (or, at least, I
%don't) talk about beliefs being contained by anything.   You may view
%PDGs a container for beliefs, but that's your idiosyncratic usage of
%the word "container" here.
%A PDG can contain inconsistent beliefs, and there is a natural way
%measuring its degree of inconsistency. 
%joe5: I don't find it so natural.
%oli5: Is there anything I can do to convince you that it is?  It has very special properties, and I find it very well-motivated.  The various alternatives I've played with do not work nearly as well, and are much hrader to motivate.  The AISTATS paper shows that this choice gives the standard modeling objective in a huge variety of situations.  I feel like that alone is enough to claim that it's natural. 
%joe6: let's not spend time on this.  You're not just trying to
%convince me, but the reader.  We don't have the space to do this.
%joe5: Moreover, we're not measuring the degree of inconsistency of a PDG; we're measuring how inconsistent PDG is with a particular proability distribution.
%oli5: Again, that's not what I was talking about. You made some edits so it says something else; what I wanted to say is simpler and better ties it into my AISTATS paper. I think bringing a joint distribution into things so early just unnecessarily complicates the story. 
%oli5: I've kept a bunch of these versions intact for reference; I ended up settling on the simpler version that you said could work depending on context, in the email.  You may think I'm solving a non-problem, but it is important to me that these first sentences withstand careful inspection by somebody who is reading through a second time and knows the definitions.

\expandafter\discard\vjoe{
%joe5*: The issue isn't correctness but how we define inferfence
%joe5*: I rewrote this pareagraph completely.  We need to tell the "right"
%  story, and tell it early.  
    Before discussing our algorithm, we must discuss what it even means to do inference for a PDG.  BNs and factor graphs represent a unique distribution. 
    Thus, for example, when we ask ``What is the probability of $Y$ given $X$''
    % Thus, when we query the probability of $Y$ given $X$
    in a Bayesian network $B$, we mean ``what is $\mu(Y \mid X)$?'' for the probability $\mu$ represented by $B$.
    But a PDG does not, in general, represent a unique probability distribution.

    Like BNs, PDGs encode two types of information: ``structural''
    information about the independence of causal mechanisms,
    and ``observational'' information,
    Corresponding to these two types of information,
    a PDG has two loss functions,
    which associate with a
    probability distribution $\mu$
    how far $\mu$ is from capturing each of
    these two types of information.
    %
    Given a weight $\gamma \in [0,\infty)$,
    we take the \emph{$\gamma$-semantics} of a PDG to be the
    set of distributions that minimize the observational loss function
    plus $\gamma$ times the structural loss function plus.
    We can also consider the \emph{$*$-semantics}, which, roughly speaking,
    is the limit of $ \gamma$-semantics as $\gamma$ goes to 0 (so amounts to focusing on
    the observational loss, using the structural loss only to break
    ties).  This gives us a family of inference notions, parameterized
    by $\gamma$ (or $*$), depending on how we choose to weight the loss
    function. 
    %
    It can be shown that, given a PDG $\dg M$, if there are distributions
    consistent with both observational and the structural information in
    ${\dg M}$, then all these inference notions coincide; that is, 
    {%%% !!!! %%% requires an assumption
        there is a
        single distribution $\mu_{\dg M}$ that minimizes both loss functions, so
        no matter how we weight the loss functions, we want to answer
        queries with respect  to $\mu_{\dg M}$.
    }
    Moreover, if $\dg M$ represents a BN,
    then $\mu_M$ is the distribution represented by the BN.  
    However, if there is no
    distribution that is consistent with both types of information, then
    the choice of $\gamma$ matters.  
    Thus, we talk about $\gamma$-inference or $*$-inference.}


Before discussing our algorithm, we must discuss what it even means to do inference for a PDG.  
A BN or FG represents a unique distribution. 
Thus, for example, when we ask ``what is the probability of $Y$ given that $X{=}x$?''
% Thus, when we query the probability of $Y$ given $X$
\def\BNPr{\mu}
% \def\BNPr{\Pr}
% in a BN $B$, we mean ``what is $\BNPr(Y | X{=}x)$?'' for the probability 
in a BN, we mean ``what is $\BNPr(Y | X{=}x)$?'' for the probability 
% $\BNPr$ represented by $B$.
measure $\BNPr$ that the BN represents.
%oli9---chris says: we should say what a PDG does represent instead of what it doesn't.  But I haven't been able to come up as something as good as this, and after thinking more I think that this is more effective in its role in advancing the story.
But a PDG does not, in general, represent

%oli5: however, after lots of thought and many attempts to rewrite it, I've decided to defer to you.

%
%joe5*: I would really prefer to have \gamma \in [0,1]; is it too late for that?
%oli5: I made this happen. However, this presentation it unnecessarily complicates the math in some places, so I've actually defined a translation later to keep the math as it is.
%oli5: One reservation I have is that it makes the two functions look more symmetric than they actually are;  keep in mind that this second loss function can be negative or positive and is bounded, while the first is only positive but can be unbounded.  My original presentation also has the benefit of looking like a free energy, which ties into the statistical mechanics literature, and the wing of the graphical models community that uses those analogies.

%oli5*: I think this is deceptive; "consistent with structural info" in my head is a lower bar than "maximally" consistent, in the sense of optimizing the structure loss function. That said, suppose this is defensible and I haven't been able to write it better...  in any case, I think it still needs attention.
%joe6: let's just leave it as is.  It's not worth the time to worry
%about it further.  As I've said repeatedly, you are far from being
%representative.
%oli5: Also (perhaps unimportantly), "consistent with both types of info" is weaker than necessary: such a distribution doesn't need to match all of the cpds (which is impossible when M is inconsistent); it only needs to be a minimum of both losses.
%joe6: this is not worth worrying about for the intro
%oli6: adding:
%joe7: why add this?  We don't have a notion of partial consistency

    The $0^+$ semantics of a proper PDG is also a unique distribution,
    and one that does not depend on the choice of a small positive number. }%
%
%oli5*: This next bit was on sketchy ground. For example: when you and I were talking earlier, I think we had agreed on a notion of qualitative incompatibility in which every distribution is compatible with a complete lack of structure (\alpha=0, or no edges). But the sense of "consistent with the structure" we're referring to here means \mu is uniformly distributed. So, in that case, this  sentence amounts to saying "if all observations are uniform, then we're talking about a uniform distribution", which is quite a bit weaker than the original text might have us think.
%oli5: also there is a technical issue, even if we are willing to use "consistent with structural information" in this very strict sense: namely, it requires that  \beta >> \alpha (or the stronger assumption \beta > 0). I added a notion of "proper" above to take care of this.
%
\def\PrM{\mu_{\dg M}}%
If $\dg M$ is also proper,
    this means there is
    a single distribution $\PrM$
    that minimizes both loss functions, 
    in which case we want to answer queries with respect to $\PrM$
    no matter how we weight observational and structural information. 
% }
Moreover, if $\dg M$ represents a BN,
then $\PrM$ is the distribution represented by the BN.  
However, if there is no distribution that is consistent with both types of information, then the choice of $\zogamma$ matters.  
%oli5: I think this next sentence is necessary given that 0^+ inference is 
% \gamma inference for \gamma equal to the infinitessimal 0^+.  Removing for now; happy to reintroduce if you prefer. 
% Thus, we talk about $\gamma$-inference or $0^+$-inference.

Since PDGs subsume BNs, and inference for BNs is already NP-hard, the same must be true of PDGs.
%joe5: why "at a high level"?
%oli5: because "polynomial time" is very coarse. We get O( n^4 ) (maybe O(n^2.8)) and they get O(n), which are quite different polynomials, and we could hope for better.
At a high level, the best we could hope for would be tractability on the restricted
class of models on which inference has traditionally been tractable---that is, a polynomial algorithm for models whose

%Interestingly, the constriction is not trivial.
%oli4: I think the segue to the next bit is lost if we get rid of the "interestingly"; without it I would rather remove the sentence entirely.

% 
%oli4: Relevant Quote from Koller & Friedman, pg 382:
% "More broadly, each of these algorithms can be described from two perspectives: as a procedural description of a message passing algorithm, or as an optimization problem consisting of an objective and a constraint space. Historically, the message passing algorithm generally originated first, sometimes long before the optimization interpretation was understood. However, the optimization perspective provides a much deeper understanding of these methods, and it shows that message passing is only one way of performing the optimization; it also helps point the way toward useful generalizations.""

% Unless otherwise specified, all scalar quantites range over the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% For us, a vector is a map from a finite set to the extended reals
%     $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
%joe4: I have never heard this terminology.  Since vectors are not
%functions, it seems to me very strange to talk about the domain of a
%vector.  Unless this is completely standard, please do not use this
%terminology.  in the sentence below, S is definitely *not* the domain
%of the vector.  People do not think of vectors as functions.  Why
%intrdocue nonstandard terminology that is (in my opinion) largely
%unnecessary.  It's a distraction for the reader.  I tried to tone it down.
%oli4: I'll concede that "domain" might be confusing in this context. 
% But the term "shape" is actually incredibly standard in machine learning. Not only  is this true in ML papers, but every numpy array, and every torch or tensorflow tensor %has a "shape" field. 
%joe5: If it's standard to use the "shape" in this context, just as
%I've used structure, then it's OK to use shape.  But only if "shape"
%is used exactly in this way.
%oli5: I have seen exactly this definition before for vectors with named dimensions, although for full disclosure: often people only use the index sets [n] = {1,...n}. So for instance, an m by n matrix is very standardly called a tensor of shape (m, n), which here is written of shape [m] x [n], which is also standard in some places. Fortunately, it lines very nicely with the extremely standard notion. 
%joe6: sigh ... I'll live with it
%oli4: your rewrite is a little more verbose less precise, and doesn't say what values the compnoents can take. I've it out, but I'll try to do the toning down myself.
%
%  We typically denote a vector $\mat u$ whose indices range over a set $S$ using
%  the notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$.  We say $S$ characterizes
%  \emph{structure} of vector $\mat u$.  Vectors with the same structure
%
For us, a vector is a map from a finite set $S$, called its 
% {\color{red}\emph{shape},}
\emph{shape},
to the extended reals $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$.
% The \emph{shape} of a vector $\mat u$ is the finite set which is its domain.
% The notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ defines a vector over the finite set $S$.
% The notation $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ defines a vector of shape $S$.
We write $\mat u := [u_i]_{i \in S}$ to define a vector by its components.
\discard{\color{gray!30!white}
    We will sometimes use superscripts as well, especially when indices depend on one another. For example, if $\dg S$ is a finite set of finite sets, then
    %joe2: (1) why is this a disjoint union?  You never said that the sets in
    %\X were disjoint.  (2) You don't want to include X \in \X and x
    %\n X in the notation; it's really ugly.  I would slightly prefer
    %u_{x,X}$.  (3) Technically, if it's a vector, you have to specify the
    %order of the elements, and the notation doesn't do that.
    %oli2: (1) This is one construction of the disjoint union. It doesn't matter if the sets % X \in \X are disjoint; even if x is a member of X1 and X2, the indices (X1, x) and (X2,x) will be different.  (2) I agree that it's a little bit ugly, but I think leaving it out is far more confusing.  (3) Not necessarily.  Just because the standard basis (e_1, ... e_n) has an order doesn't mean we have to provide an order if we use a different basis. Sure, we need an order to write down a concrete vector without reference to the basis elements, but we won't need to do that.
    % $\mat u := [u^X_x]^{X \in \mathcal X}_{x \in X}$ defines a vector whose indicies range over the disjiont union $\sqcup \mathcal X$.
    %oli2: here's a compromise
    % $[u^X_x]_{x \in X, X \in \X}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    % for each $X \in \X$ and $x \in X$.
    $[u^S_s]^{S \in \dg S}_{s \in S}$ denotes a vector which has an element
    for each pair $(S,s)$, satisfying $s \in S \in \dg S$.
    By supplying just the upper index of such a vector, as in $\mat u^{S_0}$,
    we mean $[u^{S_0}_s]_{s \in {S_0}}$, the projection of $\mat u$ onto the subspace whose upper index is $S_0$.

%nonstandard, but I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of

%oli4: I think actually the standard is much more heavily towards the transpose

% I have no problem using \cdot, but we also use the transpose once for a matrix

%oli5: I still don't see the problem --- this just means the set of variables \X is closed under union.
%oli5: in any case, this fix won't quite address the problem, because we also need to marginalize to sets of variables, for example.  Maybe this is more acceptable if I word it so it sounds more temporary, like this?:

\begin{defn}
%joe4; why not {\bf p} rather than \mathcal P; this would be more consistent notation
%oli4*: I had the same instinct a while back. That is the notation we had in our first
% paper. Here, the notation emphasizes a view of {\bf p} as a vector. Because we restrict
% to discrete variables, that is technically a reasonable thing to do here. 
% but also the indices are more complicated than you suggested with your rewrite. I think
% there's less potential for misunderstanding if we don't try to think of the cpds as
% vectors until right before we need to as a convex program. Otherwise, therere are a lot
% of technical ambiguities we need to be careful of --- like, what is \mu(X) p(Y|X)? 
% Because of that, I'm reverting to my original notation.
%joe5*: I'm sorry;  I don't get it.  You write \mathcal P, and never
  %explain what it is.  You write p_a, which is your notation for
  %a component of a vector p, but never explain what p is, and how it
  %differs from \mathcal P.  (If it does, then I'm completely
  %mystified as to how.)  
%oli5: this may have been resolved in our conversation, but just for completeness here: the notation for a vector is if I first were to define  {\bf p} = [p_a]_{a \in \Ar} --- but instead I just defined components p_a for  a \in \Ar, without making a vector out of them. Surely it's OK to use subscripts for  something else?  In fact, using \mathcal P over {\bf p} is precisely to distinguish this from being a vector. 
%joe5*: I don't understand your concerns above,
  %and I'm quite sure that the reader will find what you wrote far
  %more confusing that what I wrote.   Unless you can explain to the
  %reader (as well as to me, of course) why you insist on violating
  %your own notational conventions, you should change it back.  (I'll
  %probably want you to change it back after you've explained it as
  %well; this is simply far too confusing.)   Here is yet another

% The notation you introduced on the previous line doesn't quite work. p_a is not a number, but rather a conditional probability distribution (or, if you prefer, a vector). 
%joe5: Why is that a problem?  Who said that a vector had to be a
    %vector of numbers?  Actually, looking back at it, you did.  But
    %there's nothing in the mathematical theory of vector spaces that
    %requires this.  I woudl drop this requirement.
%-oli5: that's not true, the mathematical theory of vector spaces requires that scalars be members of a fixed field (or at minimum, a semiring, leading to the notion of a module).  In the abstract, I find it totally acceptable to present the cpds as a vector of shape \V\Ar (not of shape \Ar), although it's then further away from the more general case when variables no longer range over finite sets.  The problem is that we then have to struggle a bit more to articulate the convex problems.

Why use the precise word nonstandardly with quotes? It measures the discrepancy (even if there are other ways to measure it). 
%joe5: While I can live with "discrepancy", I suspect most people will

% "How far" means that we have a distance. 
%oli5: while there's a very long and very standard tradition of using the word "distance" to mean a symmetric measure, the underlying intuition of "how far" doesn't need to be.

% This paper demonstrates  that $\gamma$-inference is tractable for PDGs satisfying $\bbeta \ge \gamma \balpha$, which is sufficient to ensure strict convexity of \eqref{eqn:scoring-fn}, and hence a unique optimal distribution.
%joe5*: this (above) is a perfectly reasonable thing to say, but is premature,
%and is too rushed.  Before you say it, you should point out that we
%get strict conviexity if \beta \ge \gamma \alpha, and explain why.
%oli5: what do you mean by "explain why"?  To me, there's an intuitive reason that this is true, but it will be quite difficult to communicate here. Namely: \gamma\alpha is essentially equivalent to a "negative \beta instruction" to a base measure.  Presumably you're not looking for a gist of a proof here.  Do you just want it split into two sentences, like this? 
It is not too difficult to see that when $\bbeta \ge \gamma\balpha$, 
 \eqref{eqn:scoring-fn} is strictly convex, which ensures that
 $\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$ is a singleton.
This paper demonstrates that

% One case of particular interest is the limit as $\gamma \to 0$,
% Two cases of are of particular interest:

    The former is a notational convenience,

%-oli5: it's a 'facet' (maybe 'aspect' is better?) of the PDG.  In my view, it *is* a special distribution, much more so than it looks just from its definition as a certain limit. I agree with you that it's not the only distribution we should care about, but it's more than special enough to have its own name. '*-semantics' doesn't  quite do it justice; it's not at all descriptive, and we may as well just write [[M]]* at that point.  You were the one pushing for "observational" as a descriptor, and I have come to agree with that. We just need to agree on a head noun.

%joe5*: I cut this.  I see no reason that it should be our main

%*-inference, and also talk about \gamma-inference. 
%-oli5: it's still one of our two main goals. Mathematically, it's the 
% more difficult and interesting of the two, and arguably it's more useful, since it applies more broadly. As a practical matter, I still think we should end the paragraph by explaining that this is also a goal, even if we don't say it's a "main" goal. Also, this is the right place to define *-inference. 
%joe5: No need to introduce yet another bit of new terminlogy 
% (which woudl conflict with \gamme-inference in any case).
%-oli5: on the contrary, your notion of *-inference is new terminology, while \epsilon-inference does not conflict at all with \gamma-inference; as I wrote before, it's \gamma-inference for an infinitessimal \epsilon.

One of our main goals is to answer probabilistic queries with respect to $\bbr{\dg M}^*$, which we call \emph{$\epsilon$-inference},

%oli5: Without the sentence above, we still need a sentence to tie this up; the paragraph is supposed to define $0^+$ inference.
This paper also shows how to efficiently answer queries with respect

%oli4: The secondary thread of our story is that we can compute << M >>, the inconsistency.  I think this is a sufficiently important concept that it demands definition here; proposition 1 seems like an inappropriate place to make this definition to me, because one might skip over proposition 1, and really this is core background material about PDGs. 
% As for being a loss function, I'll grant that, we've already said as  much about why we care about it, but I thought it would be good to follow up on this now that we can talk about it more formally.

\section{Experiments} \label{sec:expts}

We have given the first algorithm to provably do inference in polynomial
time, but that does not mean that it's the best way of answering queries in practice;
it also makes sense to use black-box optimization tools such as
    Adam \parencite{kingma2014adam} or L-BFGS \parencite{fletcher2013practical}
    to find minimizers of $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$.
Indeed, this scoring function has several properties
    that make it highly amenable to such methods: it is
    infinitely differentiable, $\gamma$-strongly convex, and its
    derivatives have simple closed-form expressions.
%
So it may seem surprising that $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ poses
a challege to standard optimization tools---%
% Our experiments show that the techniques developed in \cref{sec:inf-as-cvx-program,sec:clique-tree-expcone} work significantly better than applying general-purpose optimization algorithms to \eqref{eqn:scoring-fn}.
%
% In some ways it is surprising that $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ poses any challege at all to standard optimization tools, given that

% it is $\gamma$-strongly convex,

but it does, 
even when we optimize directly over joint distributions.
% as we show with the following two synthetic experiments.

\textbf{Synthetic Experiment 1 (over joint distributions).} 
% We randomly generate small PDGs, and apply 
First, we randomly generate a small PDG $\dg M$ containing 
at most 10 variables and 15 arcs. 
Then for 
$\gamma \in \{0, 0^+, 
    % 10^{-8}, 10^{-4},
     \ldots, \min_a \frac{\beta_a}{\alpha_a} \}$,
we optimize $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu)$ over joint distributions $\mu$, 
either by using cvxpy \parencite{diamond2016cvxpy}
to feed  
\eqref{prob:joint-inc}, \eqref{prob:joint-small-gamma}, or \eqref{prob:joint+idef} 
    to MOSEK \cite{mosek}, 
or by using a standard optimizer (Adam or L-BFGS) built into \texttt{pytorch} \parencite{pytorch}, and choosing a learning rate
and a representation of $\mu$ in terms of optimization variables $\theta \in \mathbb R^n$. 
% Concretely, we use either $\mu \propto \max\{\theta, 0\}$ or $\mu \propto \exp(\theta)$. 
% These baselines are then run until convergence, or to a maximum of 1500 iterations.
% We then iteratively optimize until convergence 
% (or a time limit),
% We then iterate the optimizer 
We then run the optimizer
until it converges (or hits a time limit), and throw out the result if another choice of learning rate achieves a smaller value of $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu)$.
% We then throw out all but the best learning rate.
The results are shown in \cref{fig:joint-gap-time}.
Observe that the convex solver (gold and violet) is significantly more accurate than the baselines,
 % yet require similar amounts of time.
% In fact, the convex optimization is faster for small PDGs 
and also much faster for small PDGs
(although it uses more memory and doesn't scale as well; see \cref{fig:resources} in \cref{sec:joint-expt-details}).
% However, they do require more memory, and the resource costs don't scale as well.
% values of $

\textbf{Synthetic Experiment 2 (over clique trees).} 
For PDGs of bounded treewidth, \Cref{coro:can-use-cliquetree} allows us to express these optimzation problems compactly not just for the convex solver, but for the black-box baseline approaches as well.
% can be expressed compactly not only to the convex solver, but also
%
For this setting, we adapt the previous experiment as follows:
first randomly generate a maximal graph of tree-width $k$
and a PDG $\dg M$ whose hyperarcs lie within cliques of $T$; 
this ensures that the maximal cliques of $T$ form a tree-decomposition $(\C, \mathcal T)$ of $\dg M$'s structure.
Then optimize $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\Pr_{\!\bmu})$ over clique trees $\bmu$
over $(\C, \mathcal T)$. 
%joe9: I didn't understand the next sentece.  What does it mean to
%encode the fact that they're not calibrated as constraints?  More
%generally, I didn't understand the whole approach.  Why does lack of
%calibration suggest that you add a loss term?
The issue is that the resulting clique trees $\bmu$ may not be calibrated, because we cannot encode the calibration constraints; instead, common practice is to add a loss term to ``encourage'' calibration. 
Still, it is sometimes advantageous for the optimizer to simply incur that loss and violate the constraint, allowing the optimizer to ``cheat''. 
Thus, for fairness, we must recalibrate the final output of the optimizer before  evaluating it.
% \parencite[\S10]{koller2009probabilistic}.
% Because of these additional challenges, the baselines do less well in this setting.
The result is a much more significant advantage for the convex solver; 
see \cref{sec:clus-expt-details}.
% We defer the figures and tables to the appendix.

\textbf{Evaluation on BNs.}
We then applied the procedure of Synthetic Experiment 1 to the BNs in 
the \href{https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/}{\texttt{bnlearn}} repository
and found similar results (but there are many fewer data points). 
But in cases where the PDG is also a BN, it is possible to use belief propogation for inference, which is much faster and at least as accurate.
% For PDGs that are also BNs or FGs, belief propogation is strictly faster.  
% Details for all experiments, as well as tables, and more figures can be found in \cref{sec:expt-setup}.
Many more figures and details about all experiments can be found in \cref{sec:expt-setup}.
%joe7*: We need to say more here.  It took decades to get these better
%algorithms for BNs.  Ours is a first step.  We should that we expect
%that comparable improvements are possible!
% It took decades

\section{Discussion}

% We have provided an implementation of PDG inference and proved that is correct and fixed-parameter tractable. 
We have defined a family of inference notions for PDGs, 
given a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for it, and shown it to 
out-perform baselines.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \end{enumerate}
%
Still, much remains to be said about inference in PDGs. 
% Asymptotically, there may be much for improvement.
Our implementation runs in time $\tilde O(N^4)$, and our analysis suggests one of time $\tilde O(N^{2.872})$. 
But under bounded tree-width, inference in other graphical models, and nearly all graph problems can be solved in $O(N^1)$ time.

Also, when $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma$ is not convex, we can still find an optimal distribution with the concave-convex procedure \cite{yuille2003concave}, which we do in \cref{sec:larger-gamma}---but this only suffices for inference if we already know there's a unique optimal distribution.}

In some cases, this might actually allow us to do inference---say, if we happen to know for external reasons that $\bbr{\dg M}^*_\gamma$ is pseudo-convex (although we loose polynomial time guarantees and have no ability to automatically recognize such situations).
