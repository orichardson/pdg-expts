 Example:

distributions A -> B, A -> B'. 
Later realize B = B', i.e., condition on the event
 {w \in W : B = B'}
Can be done by adding a node B=B' to the network, and using BN machinery to compute marginals.
 
What are the resulting A -> B and A-> B'? well we can compute pr(A), pr(B), and marginalize out Pr(A) by Pr(B).
