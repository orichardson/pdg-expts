RESOLVING INCONSISTENCY


AGENDA
	- How to write the two pragarphs of interest pdg.tex: 
		-  Description of Inc:
			- What intuition do we want to communicate?
			- What does Joe think we should be doing here?
		- Certainty θ vs β:
			- The optimal cpts get more expensive to violate for β, and 
			
	- Non-strict PDGs. Make the case for how they will help inconsistency. 
		- positive distributions are no longer special.	
			Currently, distributions that are positive enjoy special properties b/c of Hammersly Clifford Theorem:
			For instance:
				- the global and logal Markov properties align, 
				- the only inconsistencies are in cycles
				
			If we switch to non-strict PDGs, we can get
			
		- Modeling power: conditional information, and interventions without permanently altering the model. 
			- Being

Examples + Plausible answers. Formalism should cater to all resolutions
