? What is the other standard usage of "pseudomarginal" in the literature?


Reason for labels: it's not a multi-set because it matters which one is which! Multi-sets cannot distinguish between the two elements.


Unique Distribution: set straight the confusion. There is a unique distribution, but there wasn't with a different version of extra information term. Made an error about which parameter it needed to be convex with respect to. Now everything works.


What marker to use for end of definition? Triangle marker = for example.


Causal factor
	**concede: there may be other ways to frame this. May not do exactly what causal term implies (haven't fully explored), and open to changing. It seems to look like a causality term because
		
	- α = 1: BNs. α = 0: inference 
		- example: alphacausalexample.txt
	- if maximized alone: all weight on the distributions that make cpt most deterministic
		* counteracts the entropy term 	
	- the information theoretic term that controls for counterfactual information in a CPT.


FACTOR GRAPHS:
	
	- explain local normalization factors as conversions to energies and back to probabilities  (via log -> exp, off by constant, as in the appendix)

	- big equation.
