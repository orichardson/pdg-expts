Thoughts:
	- I need to write simulations so I understand extra information better.
	- I keep working on other PDG issues. Databases, VaEs.


Agenda:
	What's going on:
		- I'm still trying to understand the information theory and the ``right thing to do'' for non-BN PDGs. 
			Intuition is designed for BNs. 
			
		
		- working on CS buddy system, have been trying to get lots of libraries configured, etc., for no reason. Making it much more complicated than it needs to be.
		
		- high level: want to focus less on the semantics. Reason: it feels like I have too many degrees of freedom and it's not clear what my objective is yet. Right now I have the theorem for BNs, and something that looks very close but is slightly off for factor graphs. 
			- want to figure out the interaction with database cycles before deciding on semantics. Don't need to include it in this paper.
		
		- also high level: want to focus more on composition. 
		
	The semantics:
		I've been writing some but I keep getting distracted by the factor graph relation, which looks so close, and whether or not I can interpret these alpha paramters. 
		
		Persistent factor graph issue: β_L and θ_L are not the same.
		
	Databases:
		General idea: 
			A world that is a setting of random variables can be thought of as a table. "Factorization by deterministic dependences" := a collection of smaller tables whose natural join is the big table. Fewer parameters. Equivalent to a deterministic (partially qualitative) BN   
			
			Deterministic BNs are distributions of natural join of all tables. This is hard to see with BNs, but PDGs make it more obvious: changing the merge of arrows is exactly what is necessary.


		Normalization 
		
		"sub-Stochasticity":
		 	Some entries in the table can be nullable. 
			Corresponds to Cobb's 3-valued logic. 
			Sufficiently powerful to give back general relations from functions
			
			As before, still helpful for modeling non-termination. No surprise because only part of a belief. 
			
			

		
		What about cycles?
			- Can be used to model time series,
