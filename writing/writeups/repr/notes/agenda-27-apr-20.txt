OUTLINE
Alpha = “Causal Struccture”, related to the qualitative BN
Beta = Quantitative constraints. 
Note: both qualitative and quantitative BNs could a priori be inconsistent (have inconsistent qualitative data, or a causal picture that is causally inconsistent.

Each link has a \beta parameter, measuring certainty of of the quantitative constraint. 
But the independences, too



----------------------------

Hope (but not question to answer): fact many BNs represent same dsitribution

Answer two questions:
(1) What does it mean to know that a certain process generates Y. 
Give explanation of how intervention works out. 

(2) That seems useful. How would I test it?   What measurements could I take 
that would make X better than X'? (Inside my head. Maybe I don't have the data, but what would determine those feelings, that would make me want to put \alpha = 2/3?)


---- t
Later: what happens if 3 edges from X to Y.

Don't understand	
	- 
	- Why sum of alphas = 1
	- How in practice to check that 2/3 is a reasonable vers
		(involve interventions & alphas).
