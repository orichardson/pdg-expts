AGENDA:
	- Focus discussion on question below.
	
	- Link MCMC algorithm for another semantics in terms of joint distributions.
	
	- Explain the markov transitions required to make sense of jiggling.
	
	- Do Calculus:
		- want a separate variable to condition on: "did I intervene". 






I don't understand this, but I'd like to.  I think I'll understand it 
better once you answer the question immediately above: what could I do 
to tell that X is better than X' in determining Y? 
	
	IF you think that Y is causally downstream from both X and X', then:

	See whether
	(A) X has less mutual information with Y given X', or
	(B) X' has less mutual information with Y given X
	
	if (A), then X' is better than Y at determining X. 
	
	
	
	If you have some more complicated, possibly cyclic causal structure, then it's more complicated. You still assign alpha the way you imagine that the causality works out, but it is no longer necessarily a conditional mutual information term that enforces this.
	
	

Surely you should be 
able to explain this without invoking entropy.  I mentioned the do 
calculus because you keep talking about causality, and this is a 
standard way of cashing out casuality.  I don't say why small variations 
should help me determine \alpha better than large ones, but I'm 
certainly willing to listen.
