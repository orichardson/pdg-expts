%Inc does), and have some lower case letters, for stylistic

%joe8*: I changed it
%oli10: I've gone through and fixed the sites that didn't get converted properly.
%\newcommand\PDGof{\Gamma}
%oli10: The notation M_B to me suggests to me that somehow B is
%indexing the data in M. 
%  I like notation that to keep separate a particular pdg M, M', maybe
%  N, L also (fraktur font) and a the function that converts them. To
%  also satisfy your desire that it be visually clear that the result
%  is a PDG, I propose naming the function in fraktur font.
%joe9*: NO!!  Oliver, you're entitled to your esthetic, but in this
%ccase I will impose my esthetic tastes on you, because I'm quite
%convinced that you are an extreme outlier.  In general, good notation
%will mke it clar what kind of an object someting is.  If we're using
%{\dg M} to denote PDGs, we should continue to do so when dentoting
%the PDG that represents a BN.  Second, Fraktur is forbidding.
%There's a good reason you see it so rarely.  Ask your friends.
%
%oli11-notation: Notation rant to follow. 
% If you have a collection of BNs, I would agree that naming the
% associated PDG \dg M_{B} is the right thing to do, because it
% emphasizes the dependence, and is defined in a scope where it won't
% contaminate the meaning of "$\dg M$"" in general.  
% Your notation takes this to an extreme I find unpalatable. You use
% this subscript notation for the general function which returns (by
% analogy) the PDG associated to an arbitrary, as of yet undefined
% PDG, which could be stored in any symbol. Therefore, M_{<symbol>} is
% bound to the conversion function, but M_1, M_2 are also used, and so
% is just normal M. I find this difficult to read. I also know for a
% fact that more than one student in your RaU class has been confused
% that the function that transforms things is the conflated with its
% output and other unrelated variables, and that a mere notational
% change improved things. It is just a mathematical fact that by
% naming things this way, the grammar you define ceases to be
% context-free, which makes it harder to parse. It also is now almost
% impossible to refer to the mathematical object corresponding to the
% funtion (e.g., which takes a factor graph and returns a PDG: the
% standard use of placeholders would give [ - ]_[.], which is
% certainly useless). The subscript also prevents you from then having
% indexed collections of models in general, because M_i now means
% transform i (and the indexed set could be indexed by a collection of
% bayesian networks...), and doesn't typecheck. IF you use M(X)
% instead, you have similar issues, and the paranetheses keep you from
% being able to use a model as a function (I woulld like to be able
% to write {\dg M) (Y \mid X)).  
%
% Two more, even scarier effects. First: what do you do if you have
% {\dg M} in scope, and want to convert a factor graph? Shouldn't {\dg
% M}(\Phi) or {\dg M}_{\Phi} have some dependence on {\dg M}? It sure
% looks like it does.  
% Second: you also have to be MUCH more careful to verify coherence
% properties. Every time you define $M_X$ for a new class of objects
% $X$, you have to be very careful that every detail of the conversion
% exactly lines up; you otherwise have to write . Now \Gamma, \Gamma'
% might not be super readable and I am sympathetic to that complaint,
% but it is always clear what computation is occuring, and which
% function is being used. If you are good about structuring your
% document and defining things, \Gamma will quickly become a part of
% the reader's langauge just as quickly (I argue more quickly if you
% use it often, because there are fewer symbols and no subtleties) as
% M_B. 
%
%I find this particular bit of notation, which I acknowledge that you
%have been using consistently, to be very poor for more reason than
%just aesthetics, and on principle I would like to avoid adopting it
%if I can. 
% I admit that fraktur font is intense, but I think that using a wide
% variety of visual symbols makes it WAY easier to track. 
% Finally, you might be surprised to learn that when I show people my
% work, I often get a surprising number of complements /specificlaly/
% regarding my notation. I can think of instances of this happening
% spontaneously, coming from category theorists, physicists, ML
% people, and even one of your students. Regularly my friends go so
% far as to accuse graders of giving me higher scores just because my
% assignment is prettier. I know I sometimes make dumb decisions, and
% my notation can become inconsistent especially when I write
% something over a long period of time (though I always plan on making
% it uniform eventually), but I believe that I'm actually way better
% than average at coming up with notation that (at least certain
% people) really like.  
% Bottom line: We seem to be on the opposite ends of some notation
% spectrum, but I also care a lot about notation. I am bad at many
% things, including focusing, and telling stories in straight lines,
% but I want you to know that in general, choosing notation is not one
% of my weaknesses. 
%joe10: maybe so, but I still find fraktur forbidding, and I suspect
%I'm not alone, and I absolutely insist that anything that is a PDG
%shoudl have an M, to remind readers that it is a PDG.  If it's
%related to a BN B, it also needs a B.  And you had many better things
%to do with your time than to write this rant ...  Reverting back to
%my preference, and asserting executive privilege.  PLEASE DO NOT
%SPEND MORE TIME ON THIS!  When you write papers without me, you can
%do as you please.
\newcommand{\PDGof}[1]{{\dg M}_{#1}}
%\newcommand{\PDGof}[1]{\dg G(#1)}
%oli10: My second choice is keeping everything with M and using parentheses, which is what I did with factor graphs. I would have preferred to do it like I suggest above with factor graphs too, but there are only so many fonts and it's not a paper on factor graphs.... This option is commented below:
%joe9: This is acceptable
%oli11: Because this is the function and not its output, and  {\dg
%M}. is already used for PDGs, I want this to be called something {dg
%M}. Some more suggestions.  
%oli11: Option 1. use mathit "pdg" (with kearning adjustment so it's
%more compact and the g does not appear offset) 
% \newcommand{\PDGof}[1]{{\mathit{p\kern-0.145em d\kern-0.17em g}} (#1)}
%oli11: option 2: same font as {\dg M}
%joe10*: NO!  while this is better, but I still have a preference for
%using notation that makes it look like a PDG.  And I find it annoying
%to be spending time on this now
%\newcommand{\PDGof}[1]{{\mathdcal{p\kern-0.05em d\kern-0.125em g}} (#1)}

We introduce Probabilistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs), a new class of
directed graphical models.   PDGs can capture inconsistent beliefs in a
natural way and are more modular than Bayesian Networks (BNs), in that
they make it easier to incorporate new information and restructure the  
representation.    We show by example how PDGs are an especially natural
modeling tool.
%
We provide three semantics for PDGs, each of which can be derived from a
scoring function (on joint distributions over the
variables in the network) that can be viewed as representing a
distribution's incompatibility with the PDG. For the PDG corresponding
to a BN, this function is  uniquely minimized by the distribution the BN
represents, showing that PDG semantics extend BN semantics.
A slight variant of the scoring function (which does not affect the
score of a distribution that represents a BN) yields the variational
free energy of general factor graphs; we use this to explain how PDGs
and factor graphs generalize BNs in orthogonal directions.%

\section{Introduction}

In this paper we introduce yet another graphical for modeling beliefs,
\emph{Probabilistic Dependency Graphs} (PDGs). There are already many
such models in the literature, including Bayesian networks (BNs) and
factor graphs. (For an overview, see \cite{KF09}.)
Why does the world need one more?  

Our original motivation for introducing PDGs was to be able capture
inconsistency. We want to be able to model the process of resolving
inconsistency; to do so, we have to model the inconsistency itself. But our
approach to modeling inconsistency has many other advantages. In particular,
PDGs are significantly more modular than other directed graphical models:
operations like restriction and union that are easily done with PDGs are
difficult or impossible to do with other representations.

We start with some examples to motivate PDGs and illustrate some of these properties.  

\begin{example} \label{ex:guns-and-floomps}
%oli12: Introduce our protagonist earlier. Changes to pronouns have
%been made throughout example. 
% You arrive in a foreign country known for having very clear laws. From
% prior reading, you ascribe probability 0.95 to owning guns being
% against the law. Upon arrival, you end up talking to some teenagers
% who use the local slang, after which you believe that with probility
% .1, the law prohibits floomps.  
Grok is visiting a neighboring district. From prior reading, she thinks it likely (probability
.95) that guns are illegal here. Some brief conversations with locals lead her to believe believe with
probility .1, that the law prohibits floomps.

% The obvious way to represent this as a BN involves two binary random variables,
% $F$ (taking values $\{f, \overline f\}$), indicating the legality of floomps,
% and $G$ (taking values $g, \overline g$) indicating the legality of guns. 
The obvious way to represent this as a BN is to use two random variables
$F$ and $G$ (respectively taking values $\{f, \smash{\overline f}\}$ and $g, \overline g$), indicating the respective legalities of owning floomps and guns.
%oli12 no paragraph break here.
The semantics of a 
%oli12
% Bayes Net
BN
offer her two choices: either assume that $F$ and $G$
% are independent and give (unconditional) probabilities of $F$ and $G$, or we
to be independent and give (unconditional) probabilities of $F$ and $G$, or
choose a direction of dependency, and give one of the two unconditional
probabilities and a conditional probability distribution. 
%oli12:
% As there is no reason
% to believe that either variable depends on the other, 
As there is no reason to choose either direction of dependence, the
natural choice is to 
assume independence, giving her the

BN on the left of \Cref{fig:gun-floomp-diagram}.
%following BN

%oli12
% Now suppose that you later discover that
A traumatic experience a few hours later leaves Grok believing that
%joe11
%``floomp'' is likely (92\%) to be another word for gun.
``floomp'' is likely (probability .92) to be another word for gun.
%oli12: I've removed the directionality by adding arrows in both directions.
%, and come to believe that if floomps are legal (resp., illegal), then
% there's a  chance guns are as well, and vice versa. 
%joe7: r seems like a atrange letter to use, although it's not a big deal
%oli12: I don't care about the letter. let's use p? Also this notation, while 
% you might not like it, is the consensus, especially in the conference we're 
% submitting to. We're already giving them something quite out of the ordinary;
% I don't want  to push it too far.  It's also expedient here as it lets us 
% immediately indicate the direction.
Let $p(G \mid F)$ be the \emph conditional \emph probability \emph
distribution (cpd) that describes 
the belief that if floomps are legal (resp., illegal),
%joe11
%then with 92\% probability, guns are as well, and $p'(F \mid G)$ be
then with probability .92, guns are as well, and $p'(F \mid G)$ be
the reverse. 
%oli12:
% A first reaction might be to
Starting with $p$, Grok's first instinct is to
simply incorporate the conditional information by adding $F$ as a parent of
$G$, and then associating
the cpd
$p$ with $G$. But then what should she do
with the original probability she had for $G$?  Should she just discard it?
It is easy to check that there is no 
%oli12
% probability distribution 
joint distribution
that is consistent with
%oli12 inserted
both
the two original priors on $F$ and $G$ and also 
%oli12: already lots of commas in this sentence. saying "the cpd" too often also gets to be a lot....
%the cpd $\mat r$, so if she
%joe11
%$p$---so if she
$p$.  So if she
is to represent the information with a BN, which always represents a consistent
distribution, she must resolve the inconsistency.  

However,
%oli12: rewrote paragraph.
% it may be better not to sort this out right away. 
% How to resolve it may be clearer 
% if you can get confirmation that guns are indeed floomps, or read the
% laws more carefully.
sorting this out immediately may not be ideal.
For instance, if the inconsistency arises from a conflation between
two definitions 
of ``gun'', a resolution will have destroyed the original cpds. A
better use of computation may be to notice the inconsistency and look
up the actual law. 

By way of contrast, consider the corresponding PDG. In a PDG, the cpds are
attached to edges, rather than nodes of the graph.
%oli12: this discussion is a distraction; it has nothing to do with PDGs over BNs.
 % we don't mention matrices anywhere else anymore, and the matrix representation
 % in the figure is both a common and inutuitive way of describing this
%
% The cpd associated with an
% edge $e$ from $X$ to $Y$ is a matrix $\mat e$, where the element $\mat e_{x,y}$
% at row $x$ and column $y$ is the conditional probability $\Pr(Y \!\!=\!\!y \mid
% X \!\!=\!\! x)$. 
In order to represent unconditional probabilities, we introduce
a \emph{unit variable} $\var 1$ which 
%oli12: no reason to be too verbose here; more important stuff is coming.
% takes on only one possible value, which we denote
takes only one value, denoted
$\star$. 
%oli12: Thus, we have
This leads Grok to 
the PDG depicted in \Cref{fig:gun-floomp-diagram},
where the edges from $\var 1$ to $F$ and $G$ are associated with the
unconditional probabilities of $F$ and $G$, and the 
%oli12
%edge from $F$ to $G$ is associated with the cpd $p$. 
edges between $F$ and $G$ are associated with $p$ and $p'$.

%oli12: Combining the two figures, squeezing digarms together further.

The ability of PDGs to model inconsistency, as illustrated in
\Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, appears to have come at a significant cost. We seem
to have lost a key benefit of BNs: the ease with which they can
capture
(conditional) independencies, which, as Pearl \cite{pearl1989conditional} has
argued forcefully, are omnipresent.
%oli12*: it seems like we should add a sentence fragment here, along
%the lines of "but we will be able to easily recover them".  Also, the
%above is kind of redundant, so I keep looking at it trying to figure
%out how to re-word, but it's so well written that I can't figure out
%what I want to do to it.

%joe13*: you still didn't finish this sentence.  I'm cutting it.
%And yet:
%oli15: The intention was to lead directly to the example. It's a clever but maybe 
% too-cute transition; it is free (fits on on the line) if you remove a comma.

% assumption in a bn because we know for certain that the
% variables are independent; rather, we just suspect that the
% identified edges are by much more important than the

% smoke are independent, controlling for parents' smoking
% habits, would extremely difficult, and would require
% empiricism to validate. 
	

\begin{example}[emulating a BN]\label{ex:smoking}

We now consider the classic (quantitative) Bayesian network $\cal B$, which has
four binary variables indicating whether a person ($C$) develops cancer, ($S$)
smokes, ($\mathit{SH}$) is exposed to second-hand smoke, and ($\mathit{PS}$) has
parents who smoke, presented graphically in \Cref{subfig:smoking-bn}. We now
walk through what is required to represent $\cal B$ as a PDG, which we call
$\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$, shown as the solid nodes and edges in
\Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg}.

We start with the nodes corresponding to the variables in $\cal B$, together
with the special node $\sf 1$ from \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}; we add an edge
from ${\sf 1}$ to $\mathit{PS}$, to which we associate the unconditional
probability given by the cpd for $\mathit{PS}$ in $\cal B$. We can also re-use
the cpds for $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$, assigning them, respectively, to the edges
$PS \to S$ and $PS \to SH$ in $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$.
There are two remaining problems: (1) modeling the remaining table in $\cal B$,
which corresponds to the conditional probability of $C$ given $S$ and $SH$; and
(2) recovering the additional
%oli12 added
conditional
independence assumptions in the BN. 

For (1), we cannot just add the edges $S \to C$ and $SH \to C$ that are present
%joe11: line shaving
%in $\cal B$, because, as we saw in \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, this would mean
in $\cal B$. As we saw in \Cref{ex:guns-and-floomps}, this would mean
supplying two \emph{separate} tables, one indicating the probability of $C$
given $S$, and the other indicating the probability of $C$ given
%joe11: more line shaving
%$\mathit{SH}$. Doing this would lose significant information that is
$\mathit{SH}$.  We would lose significant information that is
present in $\cal B$  about 
how $C$ depends jointly on $S$ and $SH$. To distinguish the joint dependence on
$S$ and $\mathit{SH}$, for now, we draw an edge with two tails---a
\emph{hyperedge}---that completes the diagram in \Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg}. 
%
With regard to (2), there are many distributions consistent with the conditional
marginal probabilities in the cpds, and the independences presumed by $\cal B$
need not hold for them. 
%oli12
% Rather than encoding the extra probabilistic information as cpds,
Rather than trying to distinguish between them with additional constraints,
we develop a a scoring-function semantics for PDGs
%oli12: hmm, the consistency is part of the scoring function. 
%    , and show that, among all distributions consistent with
%    $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$,
%joe11: so we're encoding the constraints in the semantics of the
%scoring function, rather than directly in the PDG.  This makes it a
%``soft'' constraint.  We could say that somewhere, but this seems
%like the wrong place.

%arbitrary) cpds'' means 
%which, despite an emphasis on matching (potentially arbitrary) cpds,

% for the appropriate scoring function, 
% the unique distribution with a minimum

%
specified by ${\mathcal B}$ (\Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs}).
This allows us to recover the semantics of Bayesian networks without requiring the independencies that they assume.

%But now suppose that we get information beyond that captured by the

control (call the cpd for this $p$); we would like to add this information to
$\cal B$. The first step is clearly to add a new node labeled $T$, for ``tanning
bed use''.  But simply making $T$ a parent of $C$ (as clearly seems appropriate,
given that the incidence of cancer depends on tanning bed use) requires a
substantial expansion of the cpd; in particular, it requires us to make
assumptions about the interactions between tanning beds and smoking.  
%
The corresponding PDG, $\PDGof{{\mathcal B}}$, on the other hand, has no
trouble: We can simply add the node $T$ with an edge to $C$ that is associated
with $\mat p$.  But note that doing this makes it possible for our knowledge to
be inconsistent. To take a simple example, if the distribution on $C$ given $S$
and $H$ encoded in the original cpd was always deterministically ``has cancer''
for every possible value of $S$ and $H$, but the distribution according to the
new cpd from $T$ was deterministically ``no cancer'', the resulting PDG would be
inconsistent.  
%
\end{example}


We have seen that we can easily add information to PDGs; removing information is
equally painless.   

\begin{example}[restriction]\label{ex:grok-ablate}
%oli12
% After the communist uprising, 
%joe11
%  After the communist party came to power,
  After the Communist party came to power,
  children were raised communally, and so parents' smoking habits no longer had any impact on them. Grok is reading her favorite book on graphical models, and she realizes that while the node $\mathit{PS}$ in \Cref{subfig:smoking-bn} has lost its usefulness, and nodes $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$ no longer ought to have $\mathit{PS}$ as a parent, the other half of the diagram---that is, the node $C$ and its dependence on $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$---should apply as before.
%oli4: this next sentence is less useful, and can be
    %removed; its purpose is to pre-emptively push against
    %a desire to margnialize and get a new BN.  
%joe4: let's remove it
% \begin{edge} 
% 	The rise of the communist party also came with changes in smoking habits, so a new unconditional distribution on $S$ could not be obtained by eliminating the variable $PS$. 
% \end{edge}
Grok has identified two obstacles to modeling deletion of information from a BN
by simply deleting nodes and their associated cpds. First, this restricted model
is technically no longer a BN (which in this case would require unconditional
distributions on $S$ and $\mathit{SH}$), but rather a \emph{conditional} BN
\cite{KF09}, which allows for these nodes to be marked as observations;
observation nodes do not have associated beliefs. Second, even regarded as a
conditional BN, the result of deleting a node may introduce \emph{new}
independence information, incompatible with the original BN. For instance, by
deleting the node $B$ in a chain $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, one concludes
that $A$ and $C$ are independent, a conclusion incompatible with the original BN
containing all three nodes.   
%joe7*: shortened significantly.  I don't think it's
   %worth agonizing this over this.
%oli12: Your shortening is excellent :)
%joe11: :-)
PDGs do not suffer from either problem.  We can easily delete the
nodes labeled 1 and $PS$ in \Cref{subfig:smoking-pdg} to get the
restricted PDG shown in the figure, which captures Grok's updated information.
%oli12: I want to keep some of the material  underneath it for the
%full paper though. 
% I have rewritten a lot of it.
\begin{vfull}
The resulting PDG has no edges leading to $S$ or $\mathit{SH}$, and hence no
distributions specified on them; no special modeling distinction between
observation nodes and other nodes are required. Because PDGs do not directly
make independence assumptions, the information in this fragment is truly a
subset of the information in the whole PDG. 	
\end{vfull}
% 
\end{example}

Being able to form a well-behaved local picture and restrict knowledge is
useful, but an even more compelling reason to use PDGs is their ability to
aggregate information. 
	
\begin{example}\label{ex:grok-union}
Grok dreams of becoming Supreme Leader ($\it SL$), and has come up with a plan.
She has noticed that people who use tanning beds have significantly more power
and than those who don't. Unfortunately, her mom has always told her that

	\label{fig:grok-combine}
\end{figure}

Grok is reading about graphical models because she vaguely remembers that the
variables in \Cref{ex:smoking} match the ones she already knows about. When she
finishes reading the statistics on smoking and the original study on tanning
beds (associated to a cpd $\mat p$ in \Cref{ex:smoking}), but before she has
time to reflect, we can represent her (conflicted) knowledge state as the union
of the two graphs, depicted graphically on the right of \Cref{fig:grok-combine}.  

The union of the two PDGs, even with overlapping nodes and is still a PDG. This
is not the case in general with a BN. Note that the PDG that Grok used to
represent her two different sources of information (the mother's wisdom and the
study) regarding the distribution of $C$ is a \emph{multigraph}: there are two
edges from $T$ to $C$, with inconsistent information. Had we not not allowed
multigraphs, we would need to choose between the two edges, or represent the
information some other (arguably less natural) way. As we are already allowing
inconsistency, merely recording both is much more in keeping with the way we
have handled other types of uncertainty. 
%		
%TODO: I should not say this yet. This is a related story that I haven't told yet. 
%Moreover, if Grok were to later discover that her mother had been faithfully transmitting the results of an unrelated study, she would be justified in increasing her certainty that a cpd roughly like $\mat p$ and $\mat q$ were correct.
% This suggests a result that is perhaps obvious in retrospect: the mere \emph{possibility} of inconisistency increases the value of consistency. For an agent that is guaranteed to be consistent by design, corroborating evidence has no value. 
\end{example}

Not all inconsistencies are equally egregious. For example, even though the cpds
$p$ and $q$ are different, they are numerically close, so, intuitively, the PDG on the right in
\Cref{fig:grok-combine} is not very inconsistent%

\commentout{
While a PDG is in some sense merely a set of constraints (the cpds), these constraints themselves have a useful computational meaning. Regarding cpds as stochastic matrices, we can get cpds corresponding to paths by multiplying them; equivalently, thought of as probabilistic functions, we can compose them.
	For instance, in \Cref{ex:grok-union}, if we were to give Grok
        unconditional probabilities in the form of vectors
        $\smash{(\vec s, \vec h, \vec t)}$ over the possible values of
        $\mathit{S, SH}$ and $\mathit T$ respectively, she could
        compute three distinct estimates for $\mathit{SL}$. This is
        perhaps clearest visually, but for clarity, if $\mat S$ is
        the cpd for the orange hyperedge that computes $C$ from
        $\mathit{S, SH}$, and $\mat L$ is the cpd for the

\section{PDGs: Syntax}\label{sec:formal+syntax}
We now provide formal definitions for PDGs.        
Although it is possible to formalize PDGS with hyperedges directly,
    we opt for a different approach here, in which PDGs have only regular edges,
and hyperedges are captured using a simple construction
that involves adding an extra node.

\vfullfootnote{In the factor graph literature,
          especially with regard to loopy belief propagation
          \cite{wainwright2008graphical}, it is common to
          call a collection of marginals that are not
          necessarily all compatible with a distribution
          \emph{pseudomarginals}, making a PDG in some sense a
          collection of `conditional' pseudomarginals. This
          gives an alternate, more technically precise
          expansion of PDG as ``Pseudomarginal Dependency Graph''.} 



	\begin{defn}[PDG]\label{def:model}
		A \emph{\modelname} is a tuple $\pdgvars[]$ where

            				really
            				want
            				labels
			, you'll going to need to introduce a
%set of labels as part of the definition of PDG.  I think  much better
%approach is to use multisets rather than sets.  You're being too
%fuzzy when you say ``collection'' in any case
 %         \times \mathit{Label}}$~~is a collection of
%         directed edges, 	each with a source,
%target, and a (possibly empty) label\notation{$\ell \in \mathit{Label}$}. 
%oli5*: Multisets are technically wrong: they don't distinguish
%         between ``identical'' elements. For the example with the two
%         different sources of information, it matters which is from
                          %         where.  I just want a set of labeled edges.
%joe5*: I disagree, as a purely technical matter.  You're looking at a
%multiset of edges, but associating with different elements of the
%multiset different cpds.  The cpd tells you what the source of
%information is.  Notationally, working with multiset is much
%easier than working with labeled edges.  
%oli6*: I still think this is technically wrong. The formal definition
%of a multi-set is a pair (S, m), where $S$ is the underlying set, and
%$m : S -> Nat$ is a multiplicity. I am unable to even find a
%definition for a function whose domain is a multi-set, but it is
%problematic because already in a multi-set, say, {{2,2,3,4,4}},
%there's no way of distinguishing the two different elements "4". The
%only thing in a multi-set is the multiplicity. How could you
%consistently assign one cpd p, and the other cpd q, if you can't even
%tell which is which in the represntation? To make them
%distinguishable we need to add data which lets us know which is
%which: some kind of label.
%joe6: So why not take the label to be the cpd itself?  That is, we
%can take E to be a set of labeled edges such that the label is a cpd.
%Or say that we'll abuse notation slightly and allow different instances of the
%same element in a multiset to be associated with different cpds?  We
%already have enough notation in the paper.  Why burden the reader
%with more?  Carrying around labels l in some undefined set of labels
%is ugly. 
%oli5: I think the intuition of collection is appropriate. "Set"
%implies that equality is determined in a particular way. If I
%implemented this, it would be a list, but I don't care about the
%order. It can litterally be a set if I include the label, but can
                          %ellide the details if I use the word "collection".
%joe5: But ``collection'' is an undefined notion, and this is meant to
%be a formal definition.  What is a collection of nodes?
%oli6: I think of a collection as an abstraction that allows
%itteration
% (This is certainly the definition in TypeScript and Scala). I have
%it seen it mathematically formalized this way as well before but it's
%not standard. It makes the definition more general: we may not
%actually need all the properties of a SET (here we don't care about
%uniqueness, or maybe even being able to test if something is an
%element); we only need to be able to add things, remove things that
%we know to be in it, and be able to iterate over all of them.
%joe6: Again, the maount you're spending on this is absurd, Oliver.
%But, in general, I don't think it's a good idea to use idiosyncratic
%terminology. 
%oli6: I agree that the minimum amount of time that we can spend to communicate the idea to the largest number of people involves replacing "collection" with "set". And so we will do that.
% But I do believe that it muddles intuitions and for a formal
%definition that people would use in the future, and it feels morally
%wrong to define the main object of inerest this way because it
%requires more than required, and in particular . 
                          %oli5: Other equivalent options: a function
                          %(or equivalently indexed set): Label -> (\N
                          %\times \N), plus function \N \times \N ->
                          %(set of labels).   
                          \times \mathit{Label}}$~~is a set of
                          directed edges, each with a source and target in $\N$, as well as an arbitrary label;
% \footnote{Recall that a \emph{multiset} is just like a set,
%   except that repetitions are allowed.  We use the standard notation
%   $\{\{ \ldots \}\}$ to denote a mulitset.  Thus, for example,
%   $\{\{1,1,1,2,2\}\}$, $\{\{1,2,2,\}\}$, and $\{\{1,2\}\}$ are
%   different multisets.}
%oli5: I still think this is a helpful footnote.
%  \footnote{Though likely to be
%  inconsistent, a PDG might admit parallel edges, in which we need to
%  tag edges with a label to identify them, but in most cases, we will
%  use empty labels.} 
%joe2: CUT! graphs don't have ``parallel edges''  Multigraphs (which we are not considering) do except that they're not called parallel edges.
%oli2: I think the footnote was already cut. I know they're called
%multi-graphs. It is commmon to say "graph" when they mean
%"multi-graph" (from a topological perspective, multi-graph is the
%standard object, and called a graph) and to not deal with the edge
%definitions carefully; after being told my formal symbolic
%definitions were too much I was trying here to follow the more
%cavalier style (I would have totally said multi-graph, but
%hyper-graph was so taboo so I just said graph). Unimportant, but I am
%certain that `parallel edges' is a fairly standard term for two edges
%with the same terminals in a multi-graph; Bobby used it in lecture
%yesterday, and a google result reveals tons of these use cases; I
%don't care what we call them though. 
% In any case, I still feel strongly that a multigraph is much more
% natural here in particular. I know this is not the best use of my
                          % time to respond here now,
%joe5: Indeed it's not!
%but since we keep clashing on this, and a
% bunch of my results later on hinge on this definition, I'll try to
% explain more carefully. Some reasons: 
% (1) When combining two graphs that share a link, you want to be able
% to combine them even if you don't know for sure that the eges are
% disjoint. Doing otherwise would be structurally enforcing
% consistency in the way that we are trying to argue against. 
% (2) There's a nice special case of resolving parallel edges (of the same temperature): interpreting two parallel edges from 1 in the max entropy semantics is exactly Dempster's rule of combination. I think this is very cool. We decided to leave it out of the abstract b/c it's no longer something people care about as much, but it's true, and not possible to even frame this without parallel edges. There are are other similar cases.
% (3) Composition of directed edges, which I want to talk about all over the place, almost invariably will result in parallel edges. In particular:
% (3.1) When we use inconsistency to modify beliefs later on. In figure 8, $p'$ and $p$ are parallel. 
% (3.2) THe whole story of being able to use "cached beliefs" which we have kind of dropped for this paper but will be important for the discussion of preferences, and is still applicable here, relies on 
% (3.3) We can define ``strong consistency'' (Dexter's suggested term, not mine; this is the alternate notion of inconsistency arising from having different paths?) as the special case where the path multi-graph is just a normal graph
% (4) Many other ideas I haven't presented to you yet require multi-edges to do properly. Doing this leaves open the possibility of keeping belief histories, for example. 
% Who knows if I can motivate the multi-graph to your satisfaction, but I don't want to write a bunch of hacky case work to define things later on, when this _slightly_ more general version gives me so much more. 
%joe3: I don't think that any of the above is going to make it into
%the paper.  If and when we find a need for multigraphs, I'm happy to
%have them, with the appropriate motivation.

%oli11: Quickly hint about why this works syntactically, so we can
%better summarize this contribution
%joe10*: NO!!!  This ha nothing to do with our story, It's a complete
%distraction.  I don't see the connection between a failure of
%consistency and a failure to commute (and I have a Ph.D. in
%mathematics and no exactly what the words mean).  I *strongly* object
%to including this.  If you have some interesting theorems to prove,
%you can write another paper on it.  You can also talk about it in
%your thesis if you really care.  But not in the paper!  Even if we
%could afford the space (which we can't) I would strongly object.
%oli12*: Are you serious that you don't see the connection?? We should
%talk about this.
%joe11: Yes, I'm serious.  We can discuss it after the deadline.
% I really do think it's a massive oversight not to at least mention
% this. I can see a world where mentioning this is the most important
% thing we do in the paper. I also think you hugely underestimate how
% many people care about commutative diagrams, what this buys you, and
% the implications for mathematical reasonsing.
%joe11: There are certainly people who care about this material.  They
%are an extremely small subset of the NeurIPS community.  We're
%submitting this paper to NeurIPS.  You're more than welcome to write
%a paper about this for a conference where there are substantially more pepole
%who care about commutative diagrms.
\begin{vfull}
    We have stressed that edges are interpreted differently in PDGs than
    in Bayesian Networks. Readers should be aware that this approach is
    closely related to the notion of a \emph{commutative diagram}, a
    common representation in pure mathematics. For those familiar with
    them, the potential failure of a PDG to be consistent is analogous to
    the possibility that a diagram could fail to commute. 
\end{vfull}

%joe4*: cut this paragraph.  It's a distraction.  Moreover, BN's don't
%need this ``trick'', because of the way they interpret the edges.  
\commentout{
This trick will not work for a BN. We need cpds to be associated with
edges, so that the projections do not get in the way of the other
information we would like to encode. In this case, we would like to
give some probabilistic information on the edge from $T$ to $C$, but
if we think of this picture as representing a BN, then $C$ would
require a table for joint settings of $(C \times T, T)$. The only
reasonable way to provide this cpd is to ignore the second component,
and use the value of $c$ determined by $C \times T$---which clearly
has no more information than the projection itself.     
}
\commentout{
	We can also generalize PDGs by associating with each edge $L$
        two additional parameters, a confidence $\beta_L \in [0,
          \infty)$, which can be viewed as indicating the strength of
          the belief that the cpd attached to $L$ is correct, and a
%joe5: I don't understand your intuition behind ``degree of
%causality'', and really don't like that name.  Is it standard?  
%oli6: It's not standard. It is a knob one might want to turn,
%effectively controls how important it is to preserve the cpd
%counter-factually, and my limited experience playing with it suggests
%that it lines up with other causal intuitions. Other suggestions for
%terminology are appreciated.
%joe6: I can't suggest good terminology for a notion I don't
%understand. But you definitely should avoid notation that suggests
%inappropriate connections.  I would have called ``degree of
%causality'' as the extent to which a is a cause of b.  That would
%make it somewhat related to what Hana Chockler and I called the
%degree of responsibility.  But I don't think that that's what you had
%in mind at all. 
          degree of causality $\alpha_L \in [0,1]$, which indicates
          the degree to which this cpd should be trusted if the
          distribution at its source were to change: 

	$\alpha_L = 0$ corresponds to a conditional observation that
          one does not necessarily believe will generalize, and
          $\alpha_L = 1$ corresponds to a belief that there is a real
          mechanism with the same underlying direction of dependence.  
	As we will see in \Cref{ex:alpha-motivation}, this difference
        should change our calculus for approximating a PDG with a
        distribution, and will be a crucial point of distinction
        between a BN and a factor graph. 
%In particular, for each edge $L \in \Ed$, we associate two real parameters $\beta_L, \alpha_L$ indicating the certainty in a belief, its degree of causality, respectively. 


	\begin{example}\label{ex:alpha-motivation}
		Suppose $\V(X) = \{x_0, x_1\}$ and $\V(Y) = \{y_0,
%joe6: corected typo, on the off chance that this stays somewhere.
%                \ldots, y_100\}$, and consider the cpd $\mat p$
                \ldots, y_{100}\}$, and consider the cpd $\mat p$
                associated with an edge from $X$ to $Y$: 
		
		\begin{equation}
			\bp(x) = \begin{cases}
				\mathit{Uniform}_Y & x = x_0 \\
				\delta_{y, y_7} & x = x_1
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation}

		For instance, Grok starts to notice that there is a letter in her mailbox ($X = x_1$), then her neighbor always has the same letter in his mailbox ($Y = y_7$). If Grok has no letters ($X = x_2$), her neighbor has a one of many letters (Grok has been keeping track of the distribution, which is nearly uniform)
		
		You have no idea how often or Grok gets letters or why. Which of the following intuitively seems to be a more likely marginals on Grok and her neighbor's letters?
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item She get a letter with 50/50 probability, and her neighbor gets a particular one with 50\% probability, and others with small, equal probabilities which add to 50\%. \label{item:unifprior}
			\item Grok is much more likely not to get a letter, and her neighbor gets one of 100 letters with roughly uniform probability. \label{item:infoprior}
		\end{enumerate}
		 	
				
		Though we could tell other stories with the same cpd,
                where (\ref{item:unifprior}) feels more appropriate,
                in this case it seems natural to conclude that option
                (\ref{item:infoprior}) is more reasonable. The reason
                is that the difference in information between the two
                settings is very large. If have no a priori reason to
                think one world is more likely than another, then with
                this constraint, there are 100 possible worlds where
                 $X = x_1$ and only one where $X = x_0$. Thinking that
                (\ref{item:infoprior}) is more appropriate corresponds
                to calculating the distribution of maximum entropy
                satisfying the cpd, thought of as a constraint. The
                larger the number of possible values of $Y$, the
                smaller the intuitive value of $\alpha$. 

		
		On the other hand, thinking that (\ref{item:unifprior}) is more appropriate corresponds to the causal view: in this case we start by acknowledging we know noting about $X$ and therefore assigning it the maximum entropy distribution, and then asserting that . This is roughly equivalent to asserting that $\mat p$ holds counterfactually, independent of the distribution on $X$. 
	\end{example}
	
	We therefore adopt the following definition, with both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters:

	\begin{defn}
		A weighted PDG $(\dg M, \vec \beta, \vec \alpha)$ is a PDG
	%joe4*: I would replace ``certainty'' by ``confidence''.  If you want
	%to include what you're calling ``degree of causality'' as well, you
	%*must* give some intuition here.  It can't come out of the blue.  You
	%don't have to go into detail, but you have to say something.  I have no
	%clue what it reprsents.
	%oli5: I've added more context above, and an example below.
	        $\dg M$ together with a \emph{confidence} $\beta_L \in \mathbb
	        R^{\geq 0}$ and \emph{degree of causality} $\alpha_L \in
	        [0,1]$ for each edge $L \in \Ed^\dg M$. 
	\end{defn}

	We identify an unweighted PDG with a weighted PDG where $\alpha_L
	= \beta_L = 1$ for each edge $L$.

\section{PDGs: Semantics}\label{sec:semantics}
%oli12: I dislike the sentence below. Primarily, it seems like
%cheating to come up 
% with totally different semantics depending on what you want to capture, and 
% we're really not doing that --- our three semantics are intimately
% related, and 
% can all be represented naturally in terms of the scoring function. 
%   There is more than one way of giving semantics to a PDG.  
%oli12: I think something along these lines has the additional benefit of 
% quickly speaking to why we're doing this (people write down cpds all the time). 
Although the meaning of an individual cpd is clear, we have not yet given 
%joe11: you seem to like using ``local'' and ``global'' a lot.
%Although I understand what you intend here, I'm still uncomfortable
%about the usage, because it suggests that there's a local semantics.
%oli13: There is a local semantics: the cpd itself already is a local
%probabilistic object. It is already useful on its own. You can even compose
%them, etc,... But there's ambiguity in stitching them together. In some sense
%this is the problem we address.
%joe12: but we have never talked about local semanatics or local
%probabilistic objects.  This is not the time to start!
%oli14: Anecdotally, this is the point that convinced me that semantics was 
% actually worthwhile. Many people just use cpds by themselves; I'd guess many
% ML people will be wondering why we need anything else if we already have
% the cpds that we need. Can't you just do math with those? In any
% case, "global" 
% is good enough for me.
%joe11: I left it in with the quotation marks.
%oli13: The "local" and "global" is going to also help make sure these terms
% don't come out of the blue later in the paper.
%joe12: but they come out of the blue here.  Do we really need them?
%Are they adding something useful to the discussion?  (As you can
%guess, I don't think that they do.)
%oli14: I think they are. I think this "global" here is already worth it
% even if we don't follow up. I have plenty of following up to do, but
% probably anything substantive won't make it. I have just a few
% characters on the final page. 
%PDGs any global semantics. We discuss three related approaches. The first
PDGs a ``global'' semantics. We discuss three related approaches. The first
is the 
simplest: we associate with a PDG the set of distributions that are consistent
with it. This set will be empty if the PDG is inconsistent.
%
The second approach associates a PDG with a scoring function, indicating the fit
of an arbitrary distribution $\mu$, and can be thought of as a \emph{weighted}
set of distributions \cite{HL12}. This approach allows us to distinguish
inconsistent PDGs, while the first approach does not. The third approach chooses
the distributions with the best score, typically associating with a PDG a unique
distribution.

\subsection{PDGs As Sets Of Distributions}\label{sec:set-of-distribution-semantics} 
We have been thinking of a PDG as a collection of constraints on distributions, specified by matching cpds. From this perspective, 
%oli12
% a natural thing to consider is 
it is natural to consider
the set of all distributions that are consistent with the constraints.

\begin{defn} \label{def:set-semantics} 
If $\dg M\sheq\pdgvars[]$ is a PDG, let $\SD{\dg M}$ be the \emph{s}et of \emph{d}istributions over the variables in $\dg M$ 
%oli12: "the conditional probabilities" is ambiguous, I thought it was reffering
%to p. For a joint distribution p, it's the conditional _marginal_ on the
%appropriate variables that's of interest.
% for which the conditional probabilities are exactly 
%joe11
%whose conditional marginals on are exactly those given by $\mat p$.
whose conditional marginals are exactly those given by $\mat p$.
That is, $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ iff, for all edges $L = (X,Y) \in \Ed$,  $x \in \V(X)$,  and $y \in \V(Y)$, we have that $\mu(Y = \cdot \mid X\sheq x) = \bp(x)$.
\notation{Formally,		
        \[ \SD[\Big]\dg M = \!\left\{\mu \!\in\! \Delta \V_\none (\dg M) \middle|\!
        \begin{array}{l}
        \mu(B\!\! =\!\!b \mid A\!\!=\!\!a) \geq \boldsymbol\mu_L(b \mid a) \\[0.1em]
        ~\text{$\forall (A, B,\ell) \!\in\! \Ed$, $a \!\in\!\mathcal V_A$, $b \!\in\! \mathcal V_B$} \end{array}\!\!\! \right\}\]
    }
%oli12: while I still prefer and would prefer to promote 'inhabited'
%(no negatives), I think we can agree that a single negative is easier
%to follow single negative than tripple negative.
%joe11: I have a slight preference for the original was fine, but I
%don't feel strongly enough about it to override the change.
%oli13: Maybe more equitible emphasis will help...
% $\dg M$ is \emph{consistent} if $\SD{\dg M} \ne \emptyset$, and inconsistent otherwise.
% $\dg M$ is \emph{inconsistent} if $\SD{\dg M} = \emptyset$, and consistent otherwise.
$\dg M$ is \emph{inconsistent} if $\SD{\dg M} = \emptyset$, and \emph{consistent} otherwise.
\end{defn}

	\begin{vfull}
		It turns out that this semantics only results in convex sets. This may provide useful intuition, and we will prove a stronger version of this statement that corresponds to our second semantics.
		\begin{lemma}[restate=thmsetconvex] 
			\label{prop:convex}
			$\SD{\dg M}$ is convex, for any PDG $\dg M$.
		\end{lemma}
	
		Note that being inconsistent is not the same things as \emph{over-constrained}: 	
		\begin{defn}
			$\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ is over-constrained if there exists
			  \emph{some $\mat p'$} assigning cpds to the same edges as
			  $\mat p$, such that $(\N, \Ed, \V, \mat p')$ is inconsistent
			  \notation{(i.e., $\SD{\N^\dg M, \Ed^\dg M, \V^\dg M, \mat p}
				= \emptyset$)}, and under-constrained if there are
			  multiple distributions in $(\N, \Ed, \V, \mat p')$ for
			  \emph{every such $\mat p'$}, making this a property of the
			  qualitative PDG $(\N, \Ed, \V)$.  
		\end{defn}

		We know that an under-constrained PDG is consistent without even looking at the tables. However if a we know that an \emph{over-constrained} PDG is actually consistent (when it could have easily contradicted itself), the information provides corroborating evidence, and one can take this as support in favor of the beliefs.

\label{sec:scoring-semantics}

returns a real-valued score indicating how 
%oli12
%joe11: I definitely prefer the original; why did you make the change?
%oli13: To emphasize the polarity. I'm willing to cede here, but technically
% Inc is a measure of poorness of fit, not goodness of fit; the other is more 
% in both respects. 
%joe12: undid; I don't see why Inc is a measure of poorness rather than
%goodness of fit.

well
%poorly
$\mu$ fits $\dg M$. Distributions with the lowest (best) scores are those that
most closely match the cpds in $\dg M$, and contain the fewest unspecified correlations.
%oli12: we've used this transition several times now. I think it flows
%fine without it. Removing 
	% We now make this precise.

We start with the first component of the score, which assigns higher scores to distributions that require a larger perturbation in order to be consistent with $\dg M$.  
%oli12: Do you still think (as below) that referencing an example is
%appropriate?
%joe11: while I don't think it's critical for the 8-page abstract, I
%do think it would be nice to have an example showing ``this
%distribution is more inconsistent with the PDG than that one''.  It
%can just  be a brief example, done in one sentence. I'm not thinking
%of something elaborate with a diagram.
%joe3*: It would be good to have an example of degrees of
%inconsistency here, before we give them a score.  One of the
%xamles from the intro would work, with variants of the cpd making it
%more or less consistent.
We measure the magnitude of this perturbation with relative entropy. In particular, for each edge $L = (X,Y, \ell)$, and each $x \in \V(X)$, we measure the relative entropy from $\bp(x)$ to $\mu(Y \!= \cdot\mid X=x)$, take the expectation over $\mu_X$ (that is, the marginal of $\mu$ on $X$). We then sum over all the edges $L$ in the PDG, weighted by their reliability.


\begin{defn}\label{def:inc}
	The \emph{incompatibility} of a PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ with
	a joint distribution $\mu$, denoted $\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$, is  
    \[
	\Inc_{\dg M }( \mu) := 
		\!\!\!\sum \alle \beta_L \E_{x \sim \mu_{_X}}
            \left[\kldiv[\Big]{ \mu(Y\!= \cdot\mid X \sheq x) }{\bp(x) } \right] ,
	\]
	where $\kldiv{\mu}{\nu} = \sum_{w \in \text{Supp($\mu$)}} \mu(w) \log\frac{\mu(w)}{\nu(w)}$ is the 
	relative entropy from $\nu$ to $\mu$.
\begin{vfull}
The \emph{inconsistency of PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$}, 
       denoted $\Inc(\dg M)$, is the
minimum possible incompatibility of $\dg M$ with any
distribution $\mu$,  
	\[ \Inc(\dg M) = \inf_{ \mu \in \Delta [W_{\cal V}]} \Inc_{\dg M}(\mu) . \]
\end{vfull}
%joe4: It would be useful to have a marker for the end of the
%definition.  I'm not a big fan of the triangle marker that you used
%before (and it's quite nonstandard).
%oli12: As you've probably noticed, I added a diamond marker to the definitions.
% I do not care at all what markers are used (though squares mean QED
% to me, and hence seem weird for examples / definitions) --- you can
% change both markers to whatever you want by searching for

%joe11: I prefer squares; I find the diamond a bitoff-putting,
%although I can't explain why.  Squares are definitely more standard
\end{defn}

%joe5*: My problem is that I have no clue of what you're talking about.
%(Well, that's not completely true, since I've seen some of the
%connection of entropy to codes before. But for those who haven't seen
%it, or haven't really absorbed it -- which includes me -- this is
%comletely mysterious.  You start talking about optimal codes that we
%are ``given'', and I have no idea what this is
%joe6*: what is a code for Y?  
%oli7*: It is an encoding of the values of $Y$ as sequences of bits.

distribution $\bp(x)$, and asked to transmit
%joe6: I would expect the cost to involve a difference between two
%quantities, but the formal expression doesn't seem to involve a difference.
%There is a difference in the defintion of ``extra information''
%below.  So perhaps this explnation is premature.  
%oli7: the definition of relative entropy has a log of a ratio; expanding it 
% results in the diference you're looking for.
data from $\mu(Y\mid x)$; we incur a cost for each bit required beyond what we
would have used had we used a code optimized for the actual distribution
$\mu(Y\mid X=x)$. To obtain the cost for $L$, we take a weighted average of
these costs, where the weight for the value $x$ is the probability $\mu_X(x)$.
We do this for every edge $L \in \Ed$, summing the cost.

For even more intuition, imagine two agents ($A$ and $B$) with identical beliefs described by a PDG $\dg M$ about a set of variables that are in fact distributed according to $\mu$. For each edge $L = (X,Y, \ell) \in \Ed^\dg M$, values $x,y \in \V(X)$ are chosen according to $\mu_{_{XY}}$ and $x$ is given to both agents. 

At this point, the agents, having the same conditional beliefs, and
the same information about $Y$, agree on the optimal encoding 
of the possible values of $Y$ as sequences of bits, so that if $y$
were drawn from $\bp(x)$, the fewest number of bits would be needed
to communicate it in expectation. The value of $y$---which is distributed
not according to $\bp(x)$, but $\mu(Y \mid X=x)$---is now given to agent A.
The agents pay a cost equal the number of bits needed to encode $y$ according
to the agreed-upon optimal code, but reimbursed the (smaller) cost that would have been paid,
had the agents beliefs lined up with the true distribution $\mu$.

Repeating for each edge and summing the expectations of these costs, we can view
$\Inc_{\dg M}(\mu)$ as the total number of \emph{additional} expected
bits required to communicate $y$ with a code optimized for
$\bp$ instead of the true conditional distribution   $\mu(Y \mid X=x)$. 

If $\dg M$ is inconsistent, then there will be a cost no matter what distribution $\mu$ is the true distribution. Conversely, if $\dg M$ is consistent, then any distribution $\mu \in \SD{\dg M}$ will have $\Inc_{\dg M}( \mu) = 0$.  
\begin{example}[continues=ex:worldsonly]
Recall our simplest example, which directly encodes an entire distribution $p$
over the set $W$. In this case, there is only one edge, the expectation is over
a single element, and the marginal on $W$ is the entire distribution. Therefore,
$\Inc(\dg M; \mu) = \kldiv{\mu}{\mu}$, so the inconsistency is just the
information $\mu$ and $p$, so is minimized uniquely when $\mu$ is $p$
\end{example}
%
\end{vfull}
	
$\SD{\dg M}$ and $\Inc_{\dg M}$ distinguish only
between distributions based on their compatibility with
$\dg M$, but even among distributions that match the
marginals, some more closely match the qualitative structure
of the graph than others.  
\commentout{
Suppose an agent has a PDG $\dg M$ in mind, and imagines that all sample
variation in a joint distribution $\mu$ over $\V(\dg M)$ arises as a result

%oli11: Both words are ambiguous because of the sentence structure,
%but I meant to say that we imagine the distribution is generated by
%rolling the dice in each link. What we do is clear from the
%formula. I think this is why I prefer putting the formula before the
%explanation --- people read the explanation already knowing what
%you're going to do, and then learn why you do it.
%joe10: there are reasons to put intuition before the formula, and
%reasons to put after.  I generally prefer giving a high-level
%intuition first, and then following up with more intuition after the
%formula if it's would help                
of sampling the value of a target variable $Y$ of some edge $\ed LXY$, given the
value of $X$. If this is the case, one would expect the total amount of
information required to communicate a sample of $\mu$ to be the same as the
total amount of the information required to separately encode, for
each edge $\ed LXY$, the randomness of $Y$ given $X$.

For an arbitrary PDG and $\mu$, these two quantities will differ; if the amount
of uncertainty in the distribution is lower than one would expect from the
edges, the distribution has an \emph{information deficiency}, indicating that there
are additional correlations between variables that are not captured by the
graph. The higher the information deficiency, the worse the qualitative fit between
the PDG and $\mu$.
%joe9*: Now you lost me.  What is ``surplus uncertainty''? This needs
%tob e given *much* more intuition.
On the other hand, if a distribution has surplus uncertainty, using it confers a
benefit. For instance, a PDG containing only the variable $X$
%joe9* I strenously object to the use of ``safest'' in the way you've
%used it below.  What is safe depends on utilities, which we haven't
%mentioned. 
%oli11: I think this is false. While to express "safe" in general, you
%would need a utility function, I claim that there is not *any*
%utility function that, over the joint space of random variables here,
%would change this calculus at all (except to make it so that you
                %don't care).

edges encodes awareness about $X$ but no beliefs about it. Given that $X$
could be distributed in any way (even chosen adversarially), it is safest to act
as though you believed $X$ to be uniform.  
%oli11: irrelevant because commented out anyway, but I think what I

%oli11: end comment. The summary at the end of our meeting was,
%" Given a distribution, compare the cost of specifying \mu directly
%to the cost of specifying the information on the edges for \mu.". You
%also said not to say anything about samples, but it's information
%required to specify a sample of the distribution, given the

%Let $G$ be a (multi-)graph whose nodes correspond to random variables.

%Each edge $\ed LXY$ of a PDG $\dg M$ represents a qualitative claim

%joe10*: I'm not happy about his, because ``amount of variation'' is
%not well defined. Whateever intuitions you're suggesting here is (in
%my opinion) too closely tied to entroyp.  As a technical matter, I
%think you want to talk about \mu matching \dg M.  Also, in fact, it
%does not match the definition, since it doesn't say what to do with
%parallel edges
%oli13: We already talk about matching in the sentence above.
%oli13: ALso the parallel edges is the reverse of what I'm talking about here.
%How do I people from getting this mixed up? If you think about it carefully.
%With parallel edges (b) > (a) and as we've said, there are additional
%correlations that allow for a more  compact representation. That's the case
%that parallel edges push towards ( and of course the total score is just in
%net). We still need to give intuition for the other case though; here we need
%to say something about the case when (for instance) there are no edges at all.
%joe12: I didn't understand what you wrote above
%   A joint distribution that qualitatively matches $\mu$ will intuitively
%   have as much variation as possible, except where we have claimed that
%   one variable depends on another.
%oli13*: Ok, but we need to impart slightly more detailed intuition instead of
% saying this. I know you don't like entroyp, but given that our formua uses
% entropy (Sorry), and we need to  say something of intermediate formality here
% that gives the right intuition --- we need to say something about variation, 
% or something else that's equivalent with different words. That's the 
% concept we need to communicate here. It doesn't matter if it's undefined, we
% are about to define it. You do a good job explaining it. We'll explain it 
% eve more carefully in the appendix. I promise you nobody at Neurips will care.
% People take so much information theory (and whatever else) for granted; for 
% the full paper, I think we can say enough to make you happy, because I belive
% it really is well-motivated.
%joe12: sometimes less is more.  If you can impart useful intuition.
%oli14: THe reason I keep changing your words in this particular
%section is not 
% because I don't like the way they sound, but because I think they either say
% almost nothing, or they are slightly wrong / misleading. Considering the 
% (perhaps regretably) standard % culture of talking in a cavalier way about
% information, I think I have a bit better sense of how to impart useful
% intuition about entropy.
%I'd *strongly* prefer to say something well in the appendix and nothing
%here rather than saying something not-so-good or unclear here.   
%that's good.  If what you impart is not so useful, then not so good.
%oli13: The current sentence does not serve the correct purpose (and its purpose has
% alredy been fulfilled by the first sentence in the paragraph).
% Thus, given ${\dg M}$, for each measure $\mu$, we consider how well
% the structure of ${\dg M}$ matches that of $\mu$.

Since we view smaller numbers as representing a better fit,
$\IDef{\dg M}$ in this case will prefer the distribution that
maximizes entropy.
If $\dg M$ has one edge from $X$ to $Y$, then since
$H(\mu) = H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) + H_\mu(X)$ by the well known 
\emph{entropy chain rule} \cite{mackay2003information},
$\IDef{\dg   M}(\mu) = -H_{\mu}(X)$.
Intuitively, while knowing the conditional probability $\mu(Y \mid X)$
is helpful, to completely specify $\mu$ we also need 
$\mu(X)$.     Thus, in this case, $\IDef{\dg

%that \IDef > 0?  This is not at all obvious to me 
%oli13: Oops, it's not. However, it is the condition required to get the
% second thing you mention, which in context feels like the emphasis. What I
% don't like about "sufficiently many" is that we're varying the graph while
% keeping $\mu$ constant, and so $\H > 0$ is not particularly meaningful. 
% I'm adding an edge 1 -> X so that this is correct and has the right emphasis.
%joe13*: Aargh!! You took a clean story with two nodes, and muddled it
%by adding a third node.  This is not helpful.  I reverted back.

 and $H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) > 0$ 
%while $H_{\mu}(Y \mid X) > 0$ 
%oli12: this is reversed for H, but the correct intuition for each edge.
% Because of the context, I'm assuming you meant the former and changing it.
% (so knowing $X$ tells you something about $Y$),
(so that $Y$ is not totally determined by $X$)
then we have $\IDef{\dg M}(\mu) > 0$, because the redundant edges add no
information, but there is still a cost to specifying them.
In this case, $\IDef{\dg M}$ prefers distributions that make $Y$ a
deterministic function of $X$ will maximizing the entropy of the
marginal on $X$.
Finally, if ${\dg M}$ has an edge from $X$ to $Y$ and another from $Y$
to $X$, then 
%oli12
% we minimize
a distribution $\mu$ minimizes
$\IDef{\dg M}$ when 
% $X$ and $Y$ depend on each other 
%joe11: I don't like ``have randomness'', and it's unneessary.  I
%don't see why ``vary together'' is better than ``depend on each
%other'', but I'll leave it
%$X$ and $Y$ both individually have randomness, but vary together
$X$ and $Y$  vary together
(so that $H_\mu(Y \mid X) = H_\mu(X \mid Y) = 0$) while
maximizing $H(\mu)$, for example, by taking $\mu(0,0) = \mu(1,1) = 1/2$.

%joe7*: I have no idea what ``natural'' means, and I don't see
%anything that we're doing that prefers ``naturalness''.  I think
%we're trying to match the independence structure, and using entropy
%to measure it.
%oli9*: I don't like my wording before, but I strongly dislike this
%wording. I was trying to hide the fact that we're implicitly
%specifying an independece structure: to talk about this properly we
%need \alpha, and even then it seems like we're selling ourselves
%short by starting in the middle of the argument. We make a big deal
%out of not having to keep independencs around earlier, and I think
%that story is a better one.  
%oli9*: I also think this is even less precise. There is literature
%about the ``most natural'' distribution in the maimum entropy
%literature, but there is no definition of an independence structure
%specified by a PDG. We also cannot define it properly without
%\alpha. 
%joe8*: I have now added a discussion of indpendence
%structure.  This was critical.
        %        some seem more natural than others.
%oli10:  commenting out this discussion for now, but we can use this as a fallback.
\commentout{
we prefer those whose independence structure comes closer to that of
the PDG.       
We measure how closely a distribution $\mu$ comes to the independence
structure of the PDG using entropy. 
%oli9**: I strongly disagree with this motivation. I don't think it works unless the PDG is litterally a BN. What are even the independencies of the PDG? In general it is not the kind of object where we can just port d-separation. 
%oli9*: Moreover, it covers more than independence. It also covers the maximum entropy case. I feel like until you look at the information diagrams a little more carefully, motivating this will be very tricky, and I know that you don't trust me to motivate it. 
%oli9: Perhaps we can try to write it together on a shared doc. 
To motivate our approach, we need recall some definitions and results.  
Recall that the entropy function $\H(\mu) = -\sum_{w \in
  \text{Supp($\mu$)}} \mu(w) \log \mu(w)$ (where Supp$(\mu)$ denotes
the \emph{support} of $\mu$, that is, the elements to which $\mu$
gives positive measure) can be understood as the number of bits required
to describe the exact state  \cite{Jaynes57}.  If $\mu$ is a
distribution over variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, then $H_\mu(X_i \mid
X_j) = \sum_{\{x_i,x_j: \mu(x_i,x_j) \ne 0\}} \mu(x_i,x_j)
\log(\mu(x_i)/\mu(x_i,x_j))$.  It is well known that entropy satisfies
the \emph{chain rule}: 
$H(\mu) = \sum_{i=1}^n H_\mu(X_i \mid X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1})$.
Moreover, if $X_i$ is independent of $X_k$ given $X_j$, then $H(X_i
\mid X_j, X_k) = H(X_i\mid X_j)$.  It follows that if the
independencies in $\mu$ are
correctly represented by the PDG ${\dg M}$
then $\IDef{\dg M}(\mu) = 0$, where
%joe7**: Is there any reason to believe that this is always positive
%(or always negative, for that matter).  I'm prety sure that if we
%allow multigraphs (as we do) this could go either way.  For example,
%if we have a PDG with no edges, its clearly just -H(\mu).  On the
%other hand, if we havea multigraph with n edges from X to Y, we have
%nH_u(\X) - H(\mu), which is clearly going to be positive for n
%sufficiently large.  So this needs *much* more discussion if you want
%to view it as a distance measure.

	\begin{equation}

	  \label{eqn:alt-extra}
	\end{equation}
}
%joe8*: Unless I'm missing somethings, this result is true, no matter
%what \M and \mu are, and is not hard to prove.   The key point is
        %that H(X|Y) \le H(X).  But it would *not* be true if we added
        %alphas (unless we also multiplied H(\mu) by the smallest
        %\alpha).  To see this, suppose that \alpha_L = 0 for all L;
        %then we get -H(\mu), which is clearly negative.  As a
        %consequence of this, I would strongly prefer not to discuss
        %the \alphas here.  It's not at all clear to me how to deal

%I ave no clue what this is telling me.  Your English below doesn't
%help.  As we observed when you were trying to give me the intuition
%for \alpha, this is a weird mix of qualitative information and some

%        take the constraints at face value, rather than causally (see
%        \Cref{ex:counterexample}), justifying their naming. 

%%joe3*: Can you give some intuition for why this is reasonable?
%%oli3: yeah. Here are several arguments:
%% (1) if the constraints are all you know, and you choose another distribution, you're somehow claiming to know more than you do. This is the maximum entropy distribution associated with some other constraints. 
%% (2) Specifying the wrong distribution is costly --- but much cheaper if you specified a uniform distribution. For this reason, the relative entropy from uniform to any other distribution is cheaper than the relative entropy to go back: the maximum entropy distribution is the most adaptable, paying the smallest price to specialize, where price is the expected surprise, = log (1 / p), related to energy of the associated Boltzmann distribution.
%%oli3*: More generally, I do not think it's worth the space to do any motivation like this at all. I could do it, and it would make me a better person, but it takes a lot of time, will require a lot of energy from readers, and it's a very standard thing. My guess is at least half are already on board with maximizing entropy, and providing a remedial introduction to such a deep topic in a 9-page abstract is not a good use of space. I also imagine that it will come off as patronizing to those who know what they're doing in the context of an original research paper. 
%We think of distributions with higher entropy as being ``better''.
%%joe3: reorganizing what you wrote.  
%Since we want to minimize inconsistency and maximize entropy, we
%subtract one from the other (with relative weighting $\alpha$), to get
%a score $\mathcal U_\alpha(\dg M; p)$:
%	\begin{equation}
%		\mathcal U_\alpha(\dg M; p) := \Inc(\dg M;p) - \alpha
%                H(p). \label{eqn:full-score} 
%	\end{equation} 
%joe3: This may be true, but why say it?        
%	Thought of this way, in specifying a PDG, a modeler has not
%        only specified a a distribution, but also a higher-order
%        object, that scores all distributions.  
%oli3: because mixing up the levels is problematic. Maybe it doesn't need to be said.
%joe3: why does this mean someting is wrong?
%oli3: rewording and uncommenting.
% $\Inc$ provides us with a meaningful continuous score, but as
% a semantics for PDGs, there's still something missing: $\Inc$ can
% only distinguish between those distributions $p$ that are
%         \emph{inconsistent} with $\dg M$.
% 
%oli8:added remark
\begin{remark}
	For distributions $\mu$ that exactly match the cpds in $\dg M$, then the term $\E_{x \sim \mu_X} \H (\bp (x))$ is can be recognized as the conditional entropy $\H_\mu(Y \mid X)$.
%TODO: reference fact 3 in the proof of Theorem 4.1
	If we take a variant of the extra information given by
	\begin{equation}
		\IDef'(\dg M; \mu) := \sum\alle \H_\mu(Y\mid X) - \H_\mu
			\label{eqn:alt-extra}
	\end{equation}
 	which uses this simpler term directly, we can get a clearer
        picture of the ``qualitative'' structure of a PDG. Motivating
%joe7*: If this is really true (I'm hoping it's not, and that the
%intuition I gave is sufficient), then I would not agree to include it
%in the paper.  We can't use what we can't motivate and explain!
        this properly is trickier and beyond the scope of the paper,
        but this definition will be useful point of comparison when we
        discuss factor graphs.

        energy distributions get weight 1. We introduce a scaling
        parameter $k > 0$ (the corresponding inverse temperature)
       which does not affect the rankings of distributions.

$W^k_\gamma(\mu) \in  [0,1]$, for all $k$, and hence acts like a weight in the sense of  Halpern and Leung \citeyear{halpern2015weighted}.
For now, we set $k=1$, but note that $k$ does not affect the ranking of distributions of scores according to $W^k_\gamma(\dg M, -)$, and so $\arg\max_{\mu'} W^k_\gamma(\dg M, \mu')  = \arg\min_{\mu'} \mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M,\mu')$ is independent of $k$. 
%
$W_\gamma$ and $\mathcal U_\gamma$ carry roughly equivalent information aside from the normalization, but the latter is slightly more useful and will play a larger role in our analysis, and so we notationally use this as our second semantics: $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu) := \mathcal U_\gamma(\dg M, \mu)$.

	The semantics given in \Cref{sec:set-of-distribution-semantics} does not allow us to express independencies very effectively.
	For instance, in \Cref{ex:smoking}, to fully get the joint
        representation given by the BN, we also need to somehow assume
        that $SC \CI S \mid PS$. This is possible to do explicitly
        with an extra arrow meaningless arrow, but this solution doe
        not scale well, looks like it dependence (the opposite of our
        intention), and clutters the diagram.  
	We now show that by applying the principal of maximum entropy, we can recover all of a BN's independence assumptions at once. This should make intuitive sense: maximizing entropy tend to `make things as independent as possible'. 
	Those familiar with the view of graphical models as separable exponential families may have even seen a similar result in an undirected setting \cite[e.g..][pp. 37-39]{wainwright2008graphical}.

    \subsection{PDGs As Unique Distributions}\label{sec:uniq-dist-semantics}

    Finally, we provide an interpretation of a PDG as a probability distribution.  
%joe7: I'm not sure that we've said it before, so it's not a reiteration
%    Before we provide this semantics, we would like to reiterate that
    Before we provide this semantics, we stress that
    this distribution does \emph{not} capture all of the important
%joe7
%    information in the PDG---in particular, as we have stressed, a PDG
    information in the PDG---for example, a PDG
    can represent inconsistent knowledge states. 
%oli8
%	That said, the
Still, by giving a distribution, we enable comparisons with other graphical models. 
It also 
%oli12
%joe11: undid; I find ``reveals to be'' awkward English
%oli14: fair. "show to be" is also good, but you gave me the first one
 shows that PDGS are 
%reveals PDGs to be
a surprisingly flexible tool for specifying distributions. 
The idea is to select the distributions with the best score.
%joe8*:
We thus define 
\begin{equation}
\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^* = \argmin_{\mu \in
				   \Delta\V(\dg M)} \bbr{\dg M}_\gamma(\mu).
\end{equation}   

In general, $\bbr{\dg M}_\gamma^*$ does not give a unique
distribution.  But if $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, then it does:
%joe8*: cleaner statement, which gets at what you want.  Are there any
%other useful sufficient conditions that we can give (like the ones
%that arise in factor graphs)?
%oli10: In its current state, this encompasses factor graphs.
% The only other sufficient condition I can see:
%   - It's true for any \gamma > 0 if the PDG has edges that are a subset
%		of those in a BN.
%  - There are some more involving \alphas (e.g.,  we can take convex
%  combinations of BNs this way).
%joe9: Well, alpha is gone, we certainly can't mention that.  I
%thought we had some conditions with determinism, but I'm OK with
%leaving it.
%oli11*: oh right! it's definitely also true that if it was convex
%before adding a set of deterministic edges, it continues to be convex
%afterwards. Is this actionable?
%joe10: probably not worth it
\begthm{prop}{prop:sem3}
If $\dg M$ is a PDG and $0 < \gamma \leq \min_L \beta_L^{\dg M}$, then $\bbr{\dg
M}_\gamma^*$ is a singleton. 
\end{prop}

%joe8: added some motivation and discussion
In this paper, we are interested in the case where $\gamma$ is small;
this amounts to emphasizing the accuracy of the probability
distribution as a description of probabilistic information, rather than
the independence structure of the PDG.  This is what was going on in
all the examples in the introduction.  This motivates us to consider
what happens as $\gamma$ goes to 0.  If $S_\gamma$ is a set of
probability distributions for all $\gamma \in [0,1]$, we define
$\lim_{\gamma \rightarrow 0} 
S_\gamma$ to consist of all distributions $\mu$ such that 
there is a sequence $(\gamma_i, \mu_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}$ with
$\gamma_i \to 0$ and $\mu_i \to \mu$ such that $\mu_i \in
S_{\gamma_i}$ for all $i$. 
%oli10*: We still need to prove that this limit is unique. This is
%non-trivial, so I think we should reference the appendix.. I think
%figured out a way to do this that will be rather hellish, but haven't
%slogged through the algebra. I'm still holding out hope.

It can be further shown that 
\begthm{prop}{prop:limit-uniq}

\end{prop}
Let
$\bbr{{\dg M}}^*$ be the unique element of $\smash{\lim\limits_{\gamma
    \rightarrow 0}} \bbr{{\dg M}}_\gamma^*$. 
%joe8: this should go in the appendix, where we  can discuss
%convexity.
%oli11: You've now also removed strong convexity from the appendix...

There is a unique such distribution because, as we now
show, the score is strongly convex
which can be found efficiently \cite{strongconvexopt}.

%joe7*: Is this result still true, now that we're going with the other
%definition of extra information?
%oli9: Only if \alpha\gamma < \beta for all links.
    \begin{proof}
      $\Inc_{\dg M}( \mu)$ is convex in $\mu$

		(\Cref{prop:neg-ent-convex}), so $- \gamma \H(\mu)$ is $\gamma$-strongly convex.

        convex functions must be $\gamma$-strongly convex.

        offered by alternative graphical models, which contributes to
        their relative lack of modularity. We return to this after a
        more careful treatment of unions in
        \Cref{sec:pdg-operations}.

	\subsection{Recovering Other Semantics As Special Cases of Distribution Scores}

	We have just seen that for $\gamma >0$, $\mathcal U_\gamma$ has a unique minimum,
        $\bbr{\dg M}^*$. By increasing $k$ in $W^k_\gamma$, the weights of any distribution that is not optimal go to zero. Therefore, taking a limit as $k \to \infty$, we see that $W^k_\gamma$ converges to the weighted
        distribution that puts weight 1 on $\bbr{\dg M}^*$ and weight 0 on all
                        other distributions, as shown below:
%joe3*: I have no idea why this should put weight 1 on a single
%distribution.  I'm lost!  I think we should just give a third
%semantics that amounts to picking the distribution of higest weight, 
%after stating a theorem that says that there always is one.  (Your
%results on convexity will be used in the proof of the theorem, but
%don't need to be stated separately.
%oli3*: I'm just using the standard trick to achieve the maximum without taking 
% a supremum. A supremum is not continuous, but we can get it for these strongly
% convex spaces by taking the associated temperature of the Boltzmann distribution to
% zero.  We're just doing this one level up, for the weighted distributions...
%oli4: I've made a bunch of changes so it's more readable. It still probably won't make it into the short paper, but I think it is useful intuition and verification for the naturality of the semantics.
	\[ \lim_{k \to \infty} W_\gamma^k(\dg M, \mu)
        = \lim_{k \to \infty} \exp\Big\{-k \Big(\mathcal

        U_\gamma(\dg M;\bbr{\dg M}^*)\Big) \Big\} = \begin{cases}
        	1 & \bbr{\dg M}^* = \mu \\
        	0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases} \] 
\begin{vleftovers}
   		A weighted distribution is closely related to a second order

    	naturally collapsed to a single distribution by taking an expectation.

    		\Big(\bbr{\dg M}_{\alpha_0}^*\Big)(w) &:= \lim_{k \to \infty}

%defined. Reverting.
%joe11: this will have to be rewritten in any case ...
($i.e., \Inc(\dg   M) = 0$)
 we recover the set-of-distribution semantics with
          the same trick: 
%oli4:
%	\note{thereby providing an alternate notational justification for $^*$ as a limit as $k\to \infty$}:
	\begin{align*}
		 \lim_{k \to \infty} W_0^k(\dg M, \mu)
		&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \exp\Big\{-k \Big(\mathcal U_0(\dg M;\mu) - \inf_{\mu'} \mathcal U_0(\dg M; \mu')\Big) \Big\} \\
		&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \exp\Big\{-k \Big(\Inc_{\dg
                 M})\mu) - \Inc(\dg M)\Big) \Big\}  
		= \begin{cases}
			1 & \mu \in \SD\dg M \\
			0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases} 
	\end{align*}

	In this sense, a weighted distribution provides a much more expressive semantics for a PDG than a single probability distribution, or set of them.

%joe1*: I cut this.  You haven't explained in what sense a conditional
%distribuiton is a program, you havne't motivated it, it takes us too
%far afield ...	
\begin{vleftovers}
	\subsection{As Probabilisitic Programs}\label{sec:prog-semantics}
	
	One final way of viewing PDGs is as a set of probabilistic programs, corresponding to the edges. 
	Conditional distributions can be thought of as probabilistic programs. As a result, we can compose and run them: paths from $A$ to $B$ correspond to noisy estimates of $B$ from $A$.
	
	Specifically, if $f(b \mid a) : \mathcal V_A \to \Delta \mathcal V_B$ and $g(c \mid b) : \mathcal V_B \to \Delta \mathcal V_C$ are conditional distributions, then the probabilistic composition $g\circ f : \mathcal V_A \to \Delta\mathcal V_C$ is
	\begin{align*}
		(g\circ  f) (c \mid a) :=  \sum_{b \in \mathcal V B}\!\! f (b \mid a)\ g(c \mid b)
	\end{align*}
	
	This can be recognized as a matrix multiplication $f$ and $g$ regarded as sub-stochastic matrices.
	Thinking about graphical models this way makes thinking about chains of reasoning simpler, gives us a way out of storing probability tables, and suggests additional applications.
	
	More formally, we can define
	\[ \bbr{M}_\lambda = \left\{
			\begin{aligned}
				 \text{paths } p = N_0 \xrightarrow{p^1} N_1 \xrightarrow{p^2}\cdots\xrightarrow{p^n}N_n \\
				 \text{such that } (N_{i-1}, N_i, p^i) \in \Ed^\dg M
			\end{aligned}
		\right\} \]
	
	\begin{example}
		Composition of arrows in a tables in chain is simply an easy case of variable elimination. 
		
		\[
			\scalebox{0.8}{
			\begin{tikzcd}[dpad, ampersand replacement=\&]
				A \ar[r]\& C
			\end{tikzcd}\hspace{3em}
			\begin{tikzcd}[dpad, ampersand replacement=\&]
				A \ar[r]\& B \ar[r] \& C
			\end{tikzcd}}
		\]	

		Conversely, factorization of a table $A \to C$ into tables $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ (i.e., a stochastic matrix factorization) corresponds to splitting a program into two steps, and the data necessary to describe it will be smaller if $|B|$ is small.
	\end{example}	
	
	% It also has not escaped us that PDGs have a particularly nice description in categorical terms, which we do not pursue further here.
	
	Furthermore, thinking about the mental state of an agent as a collection of programs you could run from any concept gives our first natural interpretation of a sub-distribution (more in \Cref{sec:full-model}): probability mass assigned to $\none$ by a edge $p$ has not terminated yet (if at all). 
	Even given infinite time, some paths in $\bbr{\dg M}_\lambda$ may be infinite.
	
	\begin{defn}
		A PDG $\dg M$ is \emph{strongly consistent} if every collection of paths $P \subseteq \bbr{\dg M}_\lambda$ is compatible, in that 
		$$\bigcap_{p \in P}\ \SD*{\vphantom{\Big|}p^0\circ \cdots\circ p^k} \neq \varnothing$$
	\end{defn}

	\begin{example}
		Bayesian Networks and conditional Bayesian Networks are strongly consistent.
	\end{example}

	\begin{prop}
%		$ \text{strongly consistent}  \subsetneq \quad 
%		\text{strictly consistent}  \subsetneq  \text{consistent} $
		Any PDG $M$ that is strongly consistent is also consistent, but some strongly consistent PDGs are not strictly consistent.

\subsection{Bayesian Networks} 
\end{vfull}
\label{sec:bn-convert}
{	
	A (quantitative) Bayesian Network $(G, f)$ consists of two parts: its qualitative graphical structure $G$, indicating a set of
%oli8: inserted 
	variables and
	conditional independencies, and its quantitative data $f$, an assignment of 
%oli8: expanded for clarity, removed paragraph break
	% a cpd to each node.
	a cpd $p_i(X_i \mid \Pa(X_i))$ to each variable $X_i$.
	The first is usually seen as more fundamental
%oli8: Updated to reflect new understanding of \alpha, though could use further editing
%	; one can think of the corresponding PDG as keeping only the second. 
%joe7
        but the third semantics ($\bbr{\dg M}^*$) can be
        can be understood as viewing the quantitative information as
        more important that the qualitative independence assumptions.  
%oli5: I can do without this sentence though:
%	Fortunately, there is an intuitive way to recover the
%independencies by optimizing for a natural information-theoretic
%quantity: the extra information (\Cref{sec:extra}). 
%joe5*: Kept the sentence above. Cut the rest.  I don't even know what
%contravariant means in this context.
%oli6: I find this a useful explanation of why keeping track of 
% independences messes up modularity. I explain what I mean by contravarient
% immediately below. It can be cut for space but I'm marking it for
% the full paper 
%joe6: No!  This is a distraction.  We are not writing a paper on BNs,
%or what is the right way to interpret things to get modularity. Focus
%on the story!
\begin{vfull}
	This is the more desirable option if one cares about
	modularity, because the two components are contravariant: a subset of
	the graph, and hence of the cpds, results in a \emph{super-set} of
	the independencies, and vice versa. It is in part for this reason
	that a BN does not say monotonically less when edges are deleted, or
	more when edges are added. 
\end{vfull}

%joe7: I don't understand the net paragraph, so I'm just cutting it.
To do without the independence assumptions, one might hope
        that maximizing entropy would recover the conditional
        independencies, as maximizing entropy tends to make things as
        independent as possible given the constraints --- but
        maximizing entropy alone is not enough
        (\Cref{ex:counterexample}).

%joe7: \end{commentout}
\begin{vfull}
	In response, some \cite{williamson2001foundations}\cite{holmes2001independence} have added alternate constraints of a causal flavor, which are perhaps smaller and more palatable than the full set of conditional independencies.  Williamson, for instance, introduces what he calls the \emph{principle of causal irrelevance}--- that extending a BN with variables $\{C_i\}$ with children $\{D_j\}$ where no $C_i$ depends on a $D_j$, restricts to the same distribution as the original.  However, these constraints are also overkill: by merely maximizing entropy one can already get the BN distribution for rooted trees, disconnected graphs, and even graphs that have nodes with multiple incoming edges, so long as every row in each such target node's cpd has the same entropy---none of which are reflected as a weakening of assumptions in a Williamson's principle of causal irrelevance.
	
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item (1) In contrast with a Bayesian Network, in which each node has a set of parents, each node of a PDG has possibly many sets of parents, where each set of parents corresponds to a different constraint, associated to a different table, and (2) We no longer require conditional independence of non-descendants given children
%		\item A BN is just a PDG where every cycle commutes		
%		% \item A tree. 
%	\end{enumerate}
\end{vfull}
The key insight
	is that we can recover the BN distribution if we control for
        the counterfactual nature of the cpd as a constraint, as we
        do in \Cref{sec:scoring-semantics}, allowing us to recover the
        independencies without assuming them.
Nevertheless, as we shall show, our third semantics still allows us to
recover the independencies.

	%oli5: I've introduced all of the notation, but I can explain

	%and in my opinion, is the real payout of this appraoch: not
	%only is it true for some settings of the parameters, but you
	%get th BN distribution out for ALMOST EVERY setting of the
	%parameters. 
    \begin{coro}
		Let $\cal B$ be a BN. For any $\gamma > 0$, and vector of positive numbers $\vec \beta > \vec 0$, 
		\[ \bbr[\Big]{\PDGof{\mathcal B}, \vec{1}, \vec \beta}^*_\gamma = \Pr\nolimits_{\cal B} \]
%oli5: added. I did this because you say you don't understand the
%statement above, but I have all of this explanation below as well. We
                %should probably remove one of the two.
%joe5: I didn't read this; I don't want to think about \alpha yet (and
%I still don't understand it).                  
		That is, so long as we take each $\alpha_L = 1$, the
                distribution defined by the cpds of $\PDGof{\mathcal
                B}$ with \emph{any weights} is precisely the one given
                by $\cal B$. 
	\end{coro}
	The corollary extends \Cref{thm:bns-are-pdgs} through the other two semantics, showing that the result is not sensitive to the additional parameters ($\beta, \gamma$), and works for the default value of $\alpha = 1$.
	This is true for PDGs which are structurally just subsets of BNs, where every node has at most one incoming edge. In such a structure, every cpd can be simultaneously attained perfectly regardless of how little you are attached to them ($\beta$) and the strength of the bias towards uncertainty $(\gamma)$.
	However, not all PDGs have the particularly nice structure,
        and these parameters will be important once there starts to be
        possible conflict between beliefs.

with the same distribution on $X$.  For definiteness, suppose that
$\V(X) = \{x_1,x_2\}$, 
%oli10*: I don't understand this example. Why does Gib alone matter? 
% Also I'm not convinced by the argument in any setting: just because the ones that give probability 1 and 0 are the ones that minimize \IDef, doesn't mean that all intermediate distributions score the same. Actually the scores definitely will not cancel.

% Proposition~\ref{prop:sem3}.  
% But it is not hard to see that there are two distributions that

% probability 1 or probability 0.  As a consequence,
% $\bbr{\dg   M}_{1/2}^*$ consists of \emph{all} distributions.

	Directed Factor graphs \cite{frey2012extending} impose constraints on factor graphs to resolve some of their issues and bring them more in line with BNs, but they have no semantics if the constraints are not satisfied, making them a way of visualizing factor graphs more than a novel modeling tool.

%oli8: remove subsection
	% \subsection{BELIEF UPDATING} 
%oli8: I don't know if it's reasonable to keep this for the final version, but I think it's 
% one of the most important classes of example (where we add scaffolding and reason about a digram without altering its contents). It does not require any additional theory, and we keep cutting the things of this flavor.
	\label{sec:belief-update}
	Belief revision, both through Bayes' and Jeffrey's rules, can be thought of as the addition of a new marginal to a distribution, and then a resolution of inconsistency. In Dietrich, List, Bradly \cite{dietrich2016belief}, a belief revision is an update $p \mapsto p_I$ of a belief state $p$ to a new one consistent with the input $I$. 
	
	For us, belief revision consists simply of the addition of a new edge to the picture, followed by a resolution of the resulting inconsistency. 
	With reference to \Cref{fig:belief-update}, an extension of \Cref{ex:randomvars}, consider the following update. 
	Upon noisily observing the variable $B$ to with probabilities indexed by $\pi = \{\pi_b\}_{b \in \V(B)}$, Jeffrey's rule prescribes a posterior probability $p'$ of any event $E$ by:
	\[ p'(E) = \sum_{b \in B} p(E \mid B\sheq b) \pi_b \]
	Bayes Rule corresponds the particular case of Jeffrey's rule, in which the variable is binary and the outcome is certain.

		\caption{PDG Belief Updating via Inconsistency}
		\label{fig:belief-update}
	\end{figure}
	
	To understand the update visually in \Cref{fig:belief-update}, imagine the original distribution $p$ from $\sf 1$ to $W$ being replaced by the path $p' := p(W \mid B) \circ \pi$  on the left. The gray arrow on the bottom left is the definition of the random variable, as in \Cref{ex:randomvars}, and the dashed one is its inversion, which can be computed by Bayes' rule.  %that factors through $B$ via the new observation $\pi$.
	To query the resulting distribution on, an arbitrary event $E$, with an indicator variable of the same name. Initially, we got a marginal on $E$ by going through $p$; we now use $p'$. Effectively, the orange path to $E$ has been replaced by the blue one.

	
	To observe $\pi$, we simply view it as a cpd conditioned on $\star$ and add it to our collection. 
	Although it is likely to be inconsistent, resolving this inconsistency in a way that retains $\pi$ is a belief update. 
	Even failure retain $\pi$ entirely may not be a concern: so long as an they continue to observe or remember, an agent endures discomfort until $\pi$ is incorporated. This setting is arguably more natural than a standard one: without spending energy, it is easy to forget or partially reject implications of the observation.	
	Once again, with a PDG, the resolution need not happen immediately. This makes the approach more convincing for cognitively bounded agents, who might have more pressing matters than sorting through beliefs, and who might do them out of order.

		\label{sec:algorithms}
	\subsection{Belief Propagation}
	
	
	\subsection{Sampling}
	
	One of the nice about directed graphical models is that the model itself is roughly a sampling algorithm. For instance, taking a Bayes Net $\cal B$ and generating samples according to the tables is an efficient way to sample $\Pr_{\mathcal B}$.

	This works because there is only one path, but more generally, for any conditional marginal $Y|X$, we can think of all of the different paths in the PDG different ways an agent with knowledge $\dg M$ can get probabilistic estimates of the conditional distribution $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y | X)$. The next result states that, in a precise sense, these various estimates bound the location of the marginal for this maximum entropy distribution, which suggests an efficient sampling algorithm for $\bbr{\dg M}^*(Y | X)$, after learning some weights.
	
	\begin{conj}\label{thm:maxent-hull}
		For any PDG $\dg M = \pdgvars[]$ containing variables $X, Y$, the maximum entropy conditional marginal $\bbr{\dg M}^*(y \mid x)$ is a convex mixture of the conditional marginals generated by the paths from $X$ to $Y$.  That is, there exist weights $\{\alpha_i \geq 0\}$ on the paths in $\dg M$ and a bias weight $\alpha_0$ with $\sum_i {\alpha_i} = 1$ and
		\[ \bbr{\dg M}^*(Y \mid X) = \alpha_0 \  p^{\text{unif}}_Y \sum_{p \in \bbr{\dg M}_\lambda(X, Y)} \alpha_i (p_1 \circ \ldots \circ p_k) \]
		where $p^{\text{unif}}_Y$ is the uniform distribution on $Y$, and $\bbr{\dg M}_\lambda(X,Y)$ is the set of paths from $X$ to $Y$ generated by composition and Bayes Rule in $\dg M$. 
	\end{conj}

	One natural choice of these $\alpha$'s is the certainty scores for each edge, given by a weighted PDG, but we do not have any further formal results in this direction.
	Note that it is common for humans to make decisions in this way: to estimate whether something is realistic by following multiple chains of reasoning weighting them by strength of argument.
	
%	\begin{conj}
%		The conditional marginal of the maximum entropy distribution $\bbr{M}^*(b \mid a)$ is in the convex hull of the compositions of paths $A \to B$.

	\section{Discussion}
        %oli8: entirely rewritten.
%joe7* It will need to be rewritten again, I'm afraid.  We should hint
%at what PDGs are good for: the fact that we can keep track of
%different, possibly conflict sources of information (we should make a
%bigger deal of that in the intro), the fact that we can capture lots
%of distributions (we hinted at that; can we say more?), the fact that
%they are modular (which lets us put together different sources of
%information) and the fact
%that we can model inconsistency and how people recover from
%inconsisency.  This will require us to get into the dynamics of PDGs
%(how people recover from inconsistency) and will require another
%paper, but we should mention it here.  A good discussion will easily
%fill up the 8th page.

	Given more computation, would your beliefs be more consistent? Or would you explore further, forming more extensive networks of them?

%oli10: deleted the previous text, 
	% We have given the semantics of PDGs, a modeling framework that enables formal reasoning about this kind of mental state, and is strictly more expressive than the class of Bayesian Networks. The scoring semantics for fixed $\beta_L = \gamma = 1$ recovers the factor graph. The distribution given by a PDG, however is not generally this one, but rather one that is as consistent as possible with the supplied cpds.
	% 
	% The material covered in the present paper is only part of the picture. There are two very important generalizations that we plan to cover next. First, by minorly relaxing the definition of a cpd so that it doesn't need to provide a distribution for a special \texttt{null} value, we gain a huge amount of expressive power, allowing for simpler representations of events and partial knowledge.
 	% Second, while we have discussed what happens in the limit as $\gamma \to 0$, emphasizing the quantitative part of the PDG, there is also a rich story to be told about the qualitative half. Together with the modularity provided by the PDG, and the relaxation to strict PDGs, PDGs are able to function as causal models.
%oli10: new text.
%joe9*: rewrote completely.  You have a few lines to say more.  It
%would also be good to squeeze in somewhere something about related
%work (e.g., perhaps dependency networks).
\commentout{
PDGs are a powerful tool for representing local probabilistic information.
	Though represented by a graph, the edges are interpreted
        differently. Each edge alone determines a cpd, making PDGs
        formally analogous to a commutative diagram, instead of a
        flow-chart. A more familiar network can be obtained with the
        use of multi-tailed arrows. 

	PDGs have a parameterized semantics $[[ - ]]_\gamma$, which always generalizes Bayesian Networks, and precisely becomes a factor graph when $\gamma=1$.  This exposes an implicit trade-off between quantitative and qualitative data; the two behave very differently, but are unfortunately fused in a factor graph. Both qualitative and quantitative information can be inconsistent, although the former is less straightforward, this preliminary paper we focus on the quantitative limit.

	Incorporating new variables, data, or restricting to subgraphs
        of a PDG is simple, making it possible to construct one by
        simply throwing together some pre-trained statistical
        models. Moreover, in the quantitative limit, PDGs continue to
        have local meaning, in stark contrast with energy-based models
        such as factor graphs. As a result, PDGs are not only a
        flexible representation, but modular as well. 

	The most dramatic feature of PDGs is their ability to deal with inconsistency. A PDG can track conflicting information from different sources, and its semantics identify when this occurs, rather than quietly sweeping problems under the rug.
	As a result, a user may resolve inconsistency in multiple ways. Inconsistency can be dealt with by updating one or multiple tables, by introducing introducing or splitting variables, or even left unresolved as as one searches for clarification. The pain of inconsistency can be mitigated by expressing a decreased confidence, without altering any data.

Inconsistency resolution is a pervasive phenomenon.
For example, belief updating can be naturally viewed as an instance of
resolving inconsistency: We now believe that something is true to
which we earlier assigned probabiity less than 1.  Conditioning can be
viewed as a way of resolving that inconsistency (as can other more

		\subsection{Inconsistency} \label{sec:consistency-ethos}
	
		Believing a logically inconsistent formula can lead you to arbitrarily bad conclusions, having an infeasible set of constraints makes all answers you could give wrong, and having inconsistent preferences can lose you infinite money. We don't want to build inconsistent systems or agents with incoherent views of the world, and so, where possible, we design them so they cannot possibly be broken in this way. Suppose, for example, that we are trying to represent some quantity that must be a point on the unit circle. We could do it with an $x$ and $y$ coordinate, but this could be problematic because $x^2+ y^2$ might not be 1 --- it would be safer and harder to go awry if we parameterize it by an angle $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$ instead. In the absence of performance benefits (like needing to regularly use the $y$-coordinate and not wanting to compute a sine), why would we take the first approach, introducing a potentially complex data-invariant, when we could avoid it?
		
		This line of thought, though common and defensible, is flawed if we are not perfectly confident in the design of both our system and the ways it can interact with the outside world. Using similar logic, we might ask ourselves: Why ask programmers for type annotations when all instructions are operationally well-defined at run-time?  Why use extra training data if there's already enough there to specify a function? Why estimate a quantity in two ways when they will yield different answers? Why repeat and rephrase your ideas when this could make you contradict yourself? Why write test cases when they could fail and make the project inconsistent? Why conduct an experiment if it could just end up contradicting your current knowledge?
		
		These questions may seem silly, but there is a satisfying information theoretic answer to all of them: redundancy, though costly, is the primary tool that we use to combat the possibility of being wrong. Maintaining data invariants can be expensive but provides diagnostic information; in the example above, settings of $x$ and $y$ that don't lie on the unit circle provide diagnostic information that something has gone wrong.
		In many cases, it is also possible to paper over problems by forcibly re-instating local data invariants: for instance, we could re-normalize any values of $x$ and $y$ (so long as $xy \neq 0$; we can chose an arbitrary point otherwise) at every step. While this would reduce inconsistency, it also hides red flags.
		
		Using a Bayesian Network to represent a probability distribution is like representing a circle with $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$.
		By construction, the result must be a distribution, and nothing can possibly go wrong so long as we can always decide on exactly one distribution which is sufficient for our purposes.
		%	By construction, the result must be a point on the circle, and nothing can possibly go wrong so long as we're sure that we will always have exactly enough information to determine such a point (for instance, we could never be totally clueless about the point, or just know its $x$ coordinate).
		
		
		The process of mechanistically forcing invariants is homologous to the standard practice for factor graphs: practitioners will often just assume that the density it defines is normalizable, and either forcibly re-normalize or cleverly avoid computing the normalization constant while still assuming that one exists; behavior is usually left unspecified in the unlikely event that it is not defined or zero.

	% \subsection{A LIST OF PDG BENEFITS}\label{sec:list-of-benefits}
	% \todo{Remove and refactor into appendix}
	% \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	% 	\item PDGs can represent both over-constrained and under-constrained mental states. 
	% 	\item In particular, they may be inconsistent, which gives agents using PDGs the qualitatively new kind of `epistemic modesty': the possibility of realizing that something is wrong with their beliefs.
	% 	\item Many standard algorithms, including as belief propogation, conditioning, and belief revision, can be regarded as resolution of inconsistency.
	% 	\item PDGs can emulate the functionality of other graphical graphical models.
	% 	\item PDGs are more modular, making it much less invasive to combine, reduce, or partially interpret parts of the model, compared to alternatives.
	% 	\item The modularity enables type-forming rules which can be used to implement deductive inference.
	% 	\item The many standard ways of adding and eliminating variables provides an answer to the question, ``why these possible worlds?''
	% 	\item Compared with a standard constraint satisfaction problem, individual components have of have limited impact on the semantics.
	% 	\item The class of free energies defined by PDGs is strictly more expressive than those given by alternative graphical models.
	% \end{enumerate} % trade-off: harder to analyze.

Because PDGs are a recent theoretical development, there is a lot of
guesswork in evaluating the impact. Here are two views of
%joe1
%opposit polarities.
opposite polarity.

\subsection{Positive Impacts}
One can imagine many applications of enabling simple and coherent
aggregation of (possibly inconsistent) information. In particular we
can imagine using PDGs to build and interpret a communal and global
database of statistical models, in a way that may not only enable more
accurate predictions, but also highlights conflicts between
information.

%joe1: what does fairness have to do with any of the above or below?
%This could have a critical impact on the state of fairness.
This could have many benefits.
Suppose, for instance, that two researchers train models, but use
datasets with
different racial makeups. Rather than trying to get an uninterpretable
%joe1
%model to "get it right" the first time, we could simply highlight any
model to ``get it right'' the first time, we could simply highlight any

%such clashes and flag them for review---without needing to see

such clashes and flag them for review.

%joe1: this seems redundant, so I cut it
%It is well-known that the statistically optimal prediction will
%generally not be well-calibrated and fair. 
Rather than trying to
ensure fairness by design which is both tricky and costly,
we envision an alternative: simply use
statistically optimal results, while allowing socail systems to resolve conflicts,
rather than fiddling with loss functions ourselves.
%joe7: \end{commentout}
% \end{notfocus}

\subsection{Negative Impacts}

We can also imagine less rosy outcomes. To the extent that PDGs can
model and reason with inconsistency,
%joe1: I didn't really undesrtand what you wrote below, so I cut it.
%one might worry that PDGs will
%reproduce some of the ``less rational'' human behavior. Because PDGs
%make it so easy to add information without computation, one can
%imagine a naive implementation being particularly vulnerable to
%attacks where it is fed more data than it can reasonably process. As
if
we adopt the attitude that a PDG need not wait until it is consistent
%joe1
%for use, it is not hard to see a world where it gives very biased and
%poorly-thought out conclusions---such a PDG might be likened to a
%conspiracy theorist, constantly absorbing too much information to
%process it correctly.
to be used, it is not hard to imagine a world where a PDG gives biased and
poorly-thought out conclusions.
It is clear that PDGs need a great deal more
vetting before they can be used for such important purposes as
aggregating the world's statistical knowledge.

PDGs are powerful statistical models, but are by necessity
semantically more complicated than many existing methods. This will
likely restrict their accessibility. To mitigate this, we commit to
making sure our work is widely accessible to researchers of different
backgrounds.
