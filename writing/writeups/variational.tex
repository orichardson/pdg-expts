    \section{Variational Inference}
    Suppose you would like to train a classifier, parameterized by $\theta \in \Theta$ ,to predict $Y$ from $X$. For each $\theta \in \Theta$, you have a conditional distribution $p_\theta(Y \mid X)$. Furthermore, you have samples $\mathcal D = (x^(i), y^(i))$.
    You would like to maximize the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data, e.g.,
    \[ \theta^* = \arg\amx \]

    So you instea
