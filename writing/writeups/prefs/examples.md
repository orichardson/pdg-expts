If there are $N$ boolean variables that determine the state of the world, then there are $2^N$ possible possible worlds, and $(2^N)!$ total orderings on those preferences.

Clearly, people do not have complete meta-preferences, especially because both the preferences and meta-preferences need to be encoded in the state of the world. As a result, there is no way


## Broccoli and Candy

Suppose I prefer candy ($C$) to broccoli ($B$). However, I do not want to have this preference. I then have

\[ (B \preccurlyeq C)~\land~(B \preccurlyeq C) < (C \preccurlyeq B) \]

This notation implicitly asserts that "$<$" is a valid symbol to write between any two preferences. But what happens if I add two additional properties:


Also, how do I express the generic "I like broccoli" without any associated tradeoffs? It's certainly not true that in all cases, the addition of broccoli will make my like better. Moreover, it's not at all clear that adition of broccoli to a situation even makes sense. It's not as though I can swap the "I like broccoli" bit, and get a coherent world view --- where did it come from?  Are there an infinite number of broccoli bits associated to each of the places that a broccoli could exist? Definitely some of them are not mutually compatible.

Is it just a shitty knowledge representation, then? Does it even make sense to have preferences over this variable?
