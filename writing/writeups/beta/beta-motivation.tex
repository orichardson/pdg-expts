\section{Introduction}
Confidence is an important aspect of knowledge representation.

We want to be able to entertain and reason about models we aren't sure about.

We want to be able to communicate our certainty to the users of a model, so that
we do not project too much overconfidence, and people can make the appropriate
contingency plans. 




\section{}
How confident are you that ``you will get the answer right?''
