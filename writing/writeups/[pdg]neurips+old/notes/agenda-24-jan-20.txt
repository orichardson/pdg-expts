Worries about existing work:
	- peudomarginals in Ising Model.
	- standard "Over-complete" paramterization.
	- 𝕃 vs 𝕄, Bethe approximation to entropy 
	- My issue with factor graphs taking care of everything.
	- "convexifying Bethe Energy" will do similar things to adding nodes.

Things to work out

 - Plate Models, First Order, Experiences, etc.
 		- We're capturing the right data but somehow worlds aren't right. 
			- e.g., student course
		- there is a re-usable.
 - Can specify factor graph with different paramters:
		- Subsets of nodes + [sufficient statistics θ, mean paramters, etc.]
 

Results
	- Conjecture: [[M]]_H is the same as the 



Individual bits of feedback: clarification.
 	- "Cut this. Either make multi-tailed part of the syntax or explain how they can be captured."
		>> Doesn't the next example explain how they can be captured? Maybe I should still cut or shorten it though.
