----  Definition 2: in terms of channel intervention ----(because I want to focus towards the links instead of variables, this may be a more stable intermediate intuition)
Rather than altering the value of a variable, we imagine instead altering the effect the variable has on another (via a particular mechanism/channel). This is slightly clearer for edge cases, such as interventions on the variable 1. In this presentation, we think of \alpha_L as the degree to which an agent imagines that (1) there is a process in the world that corresponds to the edge L (if there isn't one, \alpha_L=0), and (2) that modifying this process alters the distribution of at the target variable (Y).
