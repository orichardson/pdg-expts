	We introduce Probabilsitic Dependency Graphs (PDGs)
	a new, more general, class of directed probabilsitic graphical model.
	
	... which are  designed to represent inconsistent beliefs.
	
	For this reason, they are especially...
	
	PDGs have several semantics, which can all be derrived from a scoring function on joint distributions.
	There is a unique distribution of optimal score. And for PDGs that correspond to BNs and factor graphs, this
	 	coincides with the semantics given by those models.
	
	PDGs have separate qualitative and quantitative confidences, and the scoring function
		cleanly separates the qualitative parts of the model (the edges and their confidences) from the
		quantitative parts (which are the cpds)

		... and allows us to take combinations of the quantitative and quailtative information of different models.
