The goal: these are issues you care about and come up a lot! If you're using PDGs as a knowledge representation, you want to preserve pieces even in a wider setting.


FIRST SLIDE: Have to 

	more detail describing first example
	(guns vs floomps)
	
	"share legality"
	
	Nobody will understand "be irreversible"
	
	It's not so much 'breaking symmetry', but
		... add colon & words about which is parent.
		
		
BN as PDG
	Say "edges are associated with cpds, not nodes"
	
	Rephrase 2nd bullet: 
		You can't add another 
		
	add the block in that has the story about restriction
	
	Add slide: 
	you might think quant is ok, but 
		the problem is actually deeper, and already
		arises in qualitative networks.
	Add the example A -> B -> C
		
	
	> Joe says Cut.
	
SEMANTICS
	Slide on just	
		"not just empty set"
		"not all inconsistent are equal"

Add theorem for BNs
	
Give inconsistency more limelight. 
	Not an "oh by the way"
