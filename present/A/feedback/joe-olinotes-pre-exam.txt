Why is loss functions not ad-hoc?
High level, well motivated:
	> doesn't treat all inconsistencies the same way (Inc).
	> doesn't treat all consistent distribs the same way

Summarize with a few bullets:
	say: it looks ad hoc but look at the nice properties!
	Also, say it has many interpretations.
	
Thoughts: need operational sense of how to set  	alpha and beta. can do for probabilities .
 
Support for goodness: that it unifies all the other loss functions.

FEEDBACK, SEPT 8
FACTOR GRAPHS
	Have to explain \phi_is and intuition behind them.
	
	Color boxes by J
	
INCONSISTENCY: UNIVERSAL LOSS
	Slow down on "model admits principled discussion"
	Cut 2nd bullet, 


VAE
	Slow down and explain encoder. Diagram. 
	"Match Prior" -> underbrace D to connect the english with the math.

  
  
 - flexibility (independent of loss function)
