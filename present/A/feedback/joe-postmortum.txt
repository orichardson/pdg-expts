> Slide 7: You said you can do it "either way" (hyperedges or not). I'm

> to spend the extra seconds to explain what the ways are.

> Slide 12: "Bayesian networks strictly enforce the qualitative

> convinced by your explanation to him.)
>
> Slide 15: If you're going to mention "exponential family", you have to
> say something about what it is.  You can't assume that people know!
>
> Slide 16: why bring up weighted factor graphs when you've never
> mentioned them before?  If you're going to bring it up, you need to
> slow down and say more.
>
> Slide 19: You left out the 1, and just wrote -> Y.  You need to be
> consistent.
>
> Slide 20: I still don't like "the universal loss"
>
> Slide 21: You can't assume people know what a regularizer is!
> If you talk about a prior, you have to give a hint on what the prior
> is on.  This is far too mysterious otfehrwise. (To me, it was

> Slide 22: This went way too fast!  I like the idea of putting all this
> in one slide.  But you should look at the various PDGs and say a few
> words about what each of them is saying.
>
> Slide 24: You lost me here.  I didn't see where the point at infinity
> came in.  What projective plane where you looking at?  You also didn't
> tie it in to PDGs.  You had a PDG there.  You need to talk (slowly!)
> about how all the different divergences arise from a small set of PDGs.
>
> Slide 27: I still don't understand what it means to "match" a prior
> (and you never explain it).
>
> Slide 28: I don't think you ever explained the ->> notation, or the
> (\infty).
>
> Slide 32: I don't see how the inconsistency measures how far away the
> diagram is from commuting.  The equation seems to suggest that an
> exponential function is equal to an integer.  I'm lost.
>
> Slide 34: Cut dependence networks.  As you said, they're an esoteric
> graphical model.  Why hit the listener with it?  I think that all the
> listener got out of this is that it's a problem you want to solve.
> There's no intuition about why anyone should care.
