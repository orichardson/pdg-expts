THings I want to capture / Application Cases / Examples
	- Beleifs Change
		- So preferences are cached optimization preferences. At top there is the true optimization objective, and everything else is cached, and a property of SGD in high dimensional spaces, that it has some memory of previous optima. At the bottom, there are actions: the current policy.

			For the Pref Change thesis, this implies the full stack is (top part mine): 
															
														Good Empirical Practice
																↓
														Sound Updating Rules
																↓
															Belifs + 
				Objective    ⟶    Priority Base    ⟶   (Explicit or Kernel) Preferences   ⟶   Actions

			SO if your beliefs change, your preferences should change. Examples:
				- I believe that eating meat is good for the environment, and I think it's a good thing to eat beef. I prefer beef to tofu. Then I update my beliefs to say the reverse, and so my previously-consistent preferences are no longer consistent
					"be good to the environment" spawned the "eat meat" preference via certain reasons. This entire chain of preferences fails to hold when the reason falls, and because of the formation order, we should change the more 
		
		
	- Individual Music Taste Change
	- Cultural Revolution
	- Art History 
	- Value Capture


AGENDA
	EXAMPLES
		- Using meaningless variables to percieve the world -> reformulate preferences in terms of more stable variables 
		- Gamification creates intrinsic value
			- Value capture
				- grades, steps, points, money, GDP, levels 
				- Preference changes when reasoning bases are undercut
					- vegetarianism b/c good for environment, but what if we discover 
		- Consumer effect 
			- Joe biden eating a sandwich
			- Wine tastings
			
		- Biological Examples:
			- parasitism >> mutualism
			
		- Cultural Revolutions [Many are multi-person]
			- Aesthetic revolutions: minimalism on internet design as reaction to very complicated pages
			- Historical revolutions
			
		- Depression when you don't do anything
		- 

	THEORIES
		- Cognitive Dissonance as a basis

		- Mechanisms: 
			- New Samples
				- Empathy
			- Underlying belief updates
			- Negative Value Rubbing
				- Boredom  (adopting this means no steady state sol'ns)
				- Rebellion against authority / mainstream
				- Trying to be different: hipster value change
			- 

		- 	Objects: proposition x attitude
			Arrows: causal, logical, correlational / inferential

	OTHER:
		- Savage O=Y, ordering on policies subject to constraints ==> utility on actions, probabilty on states.
		
		- The entire process being cached optimization, dynamicism and lingering echos of SGD which has memory.
