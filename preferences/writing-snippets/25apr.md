# Preference Change Book Quotes + Insights

"On the most basic level, exclusionary preferences compare
relata with maximal detail. From these, combinative preferences, which compare
relata of lesser detail, are derived. In most variants of this approach, the underly-
ing alternatives (to which the exclusionary preferences refer) have been possible
worlds, represented by maximal consistent subsets of the language (Rescher 1967;
von Wright 1972; Hansson 1996). The derivation of combinative preferences from
exclusionary preferences can be achieved with a representation function." 
	**Hansson 2001a, pp 70-73**, **pp 9**


"Inconsistency may arise not only between preferences, but also between prefer-
ences and experienced satisfaction. Conflicts between expectations and experience
may lead to cognitive incongruity"
	**pp 17**

1. Utility functions' arguments are not goods, but rather a lower-level concept (nutrients), and so preference change can be driven by change of production abilities *pg. 13*

0. "One may acquire type-writing skills through sufficient
practice, and hence come to prefer type-writing letters over hand-writing them. This is a preference change that does not seem to be driven by a belief change (although it is accompanied by the acquisition of the belief that one can type faster than before)" *pg. 13*

0. Personality / Identity changes as abilities change, to reduce cognitive dissonance [Akerlof, Kranton 2000]

0. Sour Grapes: "In La Fontaineâ€™s fable, the fox approaches a tree, attempts to reach the grapes, and,
realising that he cannot, turns away, saying to himself that they were sour."

	Really, people have been thinking much too hard about this. Clearly, this is not a rational thing to do, or something we would like to model. The correct thing for the fox to do is to update belief about whether the grapes are attainable, and how much energy it would take to get them. Saying they're sour is just bad introspection or a socially face-saving move, preserving identity.
