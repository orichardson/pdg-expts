# Defn Wishlisth

- Differentiable information theoretic defn of inconsistency that lines up with the assign-joint-robability one

# Theorem Wishlist

 - [!false] Utility representation: if you can represnt all preferences by utility functions, then there is a way to combine them such that decision making is the same. Ways to formalize "decision making the same"
	- Probability of choice in each set is the same as before.

 - Preference consistency is convex: taking mixtures of compositions is always consistent. Moreover, with high probability /accuracy we can represent the truth as a linear combination of compositions, in the limit as # vars goes to âˆž.

# General Preditions

 - Ignoring beliefs that are not utilities (i.e., no relationships between anything that's not the special utility domain), we can always make a global joint utility that marginalizes for each variable like its original utility. 
 
   ... but now beliefs with 0 and 1 components can make the total picture inconsistent. This is a good reason for a smoother version of inconsistency, based on information: maybe it's not inconsistent yet but just extremely unlikely? Maybe it was just luck that another beleif wasn't epsilon off and so the difference between consistency and inconsistency is not as clear?
