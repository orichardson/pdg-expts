Writeup  of things from walk:
	- Don't worry about non-linearities! I'm working one level down, and so I can still represent non-linear functions of the kind that people care about!
	- I need to think harder about the 
	
	BAYESIAN PERSPECTIVE	 (on)
		You have a prior over distributions that X -> Y could be. This could be max entropy or something. You then update based on evidence / data, and discover a posterior distribution. You take the maximum likelihood one. Why do you do this? Because your loss is [log liklihood / KL divergence / cross entropy].
			
			Alternative view: belief updating induces a loss. 


IDEAS:
	- Cross entropy is a free energy! Has entropy + kl divergence. 

	- Conjecture: If there is only one link into U, then it may as well be deterministic --- i.e., identical behavior, predictions, estimations, etc.
		- Corolary: BN's, which effectively only have one link into every node, may as well have deterministic utility functions.

	- Conjecture: Two parallel arrows have to be "close enough", i.e., within each other's entropy bounds.

	- Fixed amount of representational space (but continuous, not lossy); variables represent partitions. 


to come back to:
	Notion of interpolation / mixtures / convex combinations, has something to do with Serre Fibrations maybe. Definitely has to do with the independence axiom of vNM utility functions.

Aug 4: plan.

	I still need to give Joe a writeup. This is the primary thing I'm doing today. Since it's already nearly 4pm, I have not all that much time, and so I should focus entirely on this. I have several things I've promised him, so I should deliver those, but there are also a number of other things I've been wanting to write down, and I should not hesitate to write those down as well, or perhaps even instead, if the opportunity arises --- BUT the time for sitting in streams and thinking is over. I need to fucking produce text that people can read. 
	
	Some things before I start:
		- Try starting with an outline and then revising

		DECISION: do I use overleaf, or git?
			- overleaf: easier to collaborate in real time, can separate from the actual papers that I compile.
			- git: can keep track in my own file system (why good?), can use whatever editor I want. Share by emailing tex back and forth? By pushing / pulling git files? This is harder.

			RESOLUTION: use overleaf for weekly project wrieteups. Use git for more important giant document, put weekly writeups together. Also in 
			

			
	
	What is the question I'm trying to answer? The problem I'm trying to solve? What's the story I'm trying to tell?

		[*] How to model preferences that change in a way that comprts with humans'. However, this has already been done: see book on preference change
		[*] A graphical language that can represent constraints (including probabalistic ones), awareness/possibility, and preferences all together. 
		[*] A joint picture of beliefs and preferences which explain show both of them change, lining up with belief revision on one hand, and standard ways of thinking about preference revision on the others.
		[*] Some preference and belief axioms can be thought of as extra structure inside this system.
		
		
PROBLEMS:
	Two conflicting interpretations of diagrams: 
	 	(1)  nodes take on particular values, and the arrows between them are marginals between them must be realized by some joint distribution. [!and prefer max entropy]
		

OUTLINE OF WEEKLY WRITEUP:
	- vNM utility functions analysis
		- vnM theorem:  ∃ utilities on X reprsenting prefs on ΔX ⟺ prefs satisfy (continuity, order, independence)  
		- In my framework: three nodes.
		- Can also extend to risk aversion by adding extra nodes.
		
	- Savage and Supervised learning
	- Proof of BN conjecture
	- NP Hardness


OUTLINE OF STORY SO FAR
	
	Preferences Change. In predictable ways. They interact with beliefs in multiple ways.
