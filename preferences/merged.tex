%	This work an be motivated in many different ways; I imagine the most compelling one to depend on who you are and what you already care about. In any individual paper I plan to only include one of these, but until the audience has been narrowed, I want to keep all of them around. %to remind myself which directions I want to push, and to record selling points outside of the best publishing path.

	\section{Good Reasons Not To Maximize Utility}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{No utility function}. Maybe your preferences are not representable in this way --- maybe they violate the vNM axioms, or you just don't have anything that resembles an ordered set. Maybe your intrinsic utility is stochastic.
		
		\item \textbf{No complete prior.} It is possible that you're not a Bayesian, and don't have (access to) a probability distribution on all salient features of your world\footnote{In fact, once we add enough representational complexity to our world, this is impossible to have; see section \ref{sec:impossible-prior}}.  
%		Of course, if you accept Savage's axioms, then you act as though you have both a probability distribution over states and a utility function
		
		\item \textbf{Thinking takes time.} (this constrains the complexity of your utility and probability information, or at least requires them to be in a form that admits fast computations)
		
		\item \textbf{Internal Actions.} In addition to the external actions, there are also invisible mental ones: nobody has complete control over what they do in all respects at all times. Emotionally preparing yourself to talk to your boss, warming up your fingers to play piano, and intentionally committing a phone number to memory are all examples of mental actions, which are rarely modeled. More generally, for any interface with the world that a model prescribes, there will be extra 
		
		 %you may not know exactly what it is you have to do in orde to 
		\item \textbf{Different world representation.} 
%			You have a distorted perception of the world. 
			Models, both in probabalistic reasoning and decision theory, usually start by defining the set of possible states of the system. For a modal logician, this is the underlying set of a Kripke structure; for probability theorists, it's a set of outcomes. Everything works well if you set up a model in which the agents are aware of the structure you've set up, but simply don't know what world they're in --- but nothing precludes them from conceptualizing things in entirely different terms
			
			There are of course ways of putting together

	\end{enumerate}	

	Despite the fact that there has been work backing off of each of these assumptions, utility maximization is still ubiquitous (and taken for granted) in most primary applications, including consumption models and the construction of artificial agents. In section \ref{sec:optimization-bad} I argue that this is the source of some cultural problems. But part of the reason that many of the other techniques has not gained traction is that none is as clean and as useful as expected utility maximization, and to the best of my knowledge people try to isolate and tackle these issues individually. My framework provides a way of representing many of these issues effectively and cleanly, while also reducing to the expected utility computations when none of these issues apply. 


	
%	\section{A Temporal Extension}
%	
%	Many issues with decision theory can be attributed to a failure to account for the passage of time. 
%	One popular example of this is the ubiquitous assumption of cognitive unboundedness: in a static world, where everything is frozen except your own thoughts, you can afford to do decision theory exactly by computing expected utility. You have only one decision to make
%	
%	Still, cognitive boundedness is only one example. When we move to a dynamic setting, most classical results no longer apply, though people often like to pretend that they do.

	\part{Belief Representations}
	
	\begin{defn}\label{def:mcg}
		A marginal constraint graph (MCG) is a tuple 
		\[ \left(\mathcal N : \mathbf{FinSet},~~\mathcal L : 2^{\cal N \times N},~~ \langle\mathcal S, \Sigma\rangle : \mathcal N \to \mathbf{MeasSet}, ~~\mathbf p : \prod_{(A,B): \mathcal L} \left[ \Big. \mathcal S_A \times \Sigma_B \to [0,1]\right] \right) \]
		where $p(L)$ is a Markov kernel, i.e., for every $L[A,B] : \mathcal L$, and $a \in \mathcal S_A$, $\mathbf p_L[a \mid \cdot~]$ is a probability distribution on $(\mathcal S_B, \Sigma_B)$, and $\mathbf p_L[~\cdot \mid B]$ is $\Sigma_A$-measurable for every $B \in \Sigma_B$.

	\part{Value Representations}
	
	The first strand of this project is a general representation of many ways that have been historically used to represent values: namely, utilities, goals, desires, preferences, choice functions, and natural extensions of these suggested by this representation, some of which are also well-studied. 
	
	\section{Setup}
	
	% There are two key insights / differences:
	% (1) allowing for a variety of scopes: you don't need to supply the data on all possible configurations at once.
	% (2) taking a categorical perspecitve, viewing these data as all special kinds of maps.
	
	The general idea is that to attach some additional preference data to each alternative in a domain
	
	\subsection{Definitions}
	

	
	\section{Reductions}
	
	The standard tool to represent values (and the ones that people are most familiar with) are orders, i.e., flat categories. 
	
	The simplest non-trivial order is:
	\begin{center}
		\raisebox{0.7em}{$\mathbb B = $}~\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node[pt=0] at (0,1){};
			\node[pt=1, right=1.2em of 0] {};
			\coordinate[below=0.3em of 0] (gutter);
			\node[right=0.6em of 0,anchor=center]{$\leqc$};
			\node[draw=gray, rounded corners=2, inner sep=0.5em, fit={\lab{0}\lab{1}(gutter)}] {}; 
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Desires}
	
	I want $\varphi$, is 
	
	One standard logical approach would be to give a Kripke model, so that a statment like $s \vDash W_{\alpha} \varphi$, for instance, would be true when agent $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ in state $s$. In such a model, there is already machinery for talking about the set of all possible states (call it $\cal W$), and so effectively we have specified a function $W_\alpha \varphi: \mathcal W \to \mathbb B$, which assigns 1 to worlds where $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ and 0 to the others.
	
	This is the behavior we would like to capture, but rather than use the set of possible worlds $\cal W$, we will adopt 
	
	
	\subsection{Utilities}
	
		
	
	A utility function $u : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ is a $\mathbb R$-value on the set of outcomes $\Omega$. 
	
	Effectively, 

	
	\subsection{Preferences}
	We can also consider orders which are not total; a discrete order encodes an inability to compare any of the options, lattices encode a possible inability to compare individual options, but provide a way to formalize the combination the best and worst features of two alternatives.
	
	
	An order is a function $\leq: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbbm 2$

	\section{Consistency}
	\subsection{Pairwise Consistency}
	Many of our motivating examples can be thought of as a ``behavioral inconsistency'': you value one thing, but your actions are inconsistent with it. Maybe you value sleep, are aware that to get sleep you need to go to bed early, and yet still do something you know is less valuable instead, such as checking social media. Maybe you
