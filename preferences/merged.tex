	\part{Motivations and Intuition}
	This work an be motivated in many different ways; I imagine the most compelling one to depend on who you are and what you already care about. In any individual paper I plan to only include one of these, but until the audience has been narrowed, I want to keep all of them around for my own sake: to remind myself which directions I want to push, and to record selling points outside of the best publishing path.

	\part{Value Representations}
	
	The first strand of this project is a general representation of many ways that have been historically used to represent values: namely, utilities, goals, desires, preferences, choice functions, and natural extensions of these suggested by this representation, some of which are also well-studied. 
	
	\section{Definitions}
	
	
	
	
	% There are two key insights / differences:
	% (1) allowing for a variety of scopes: you don't need to supply the data on all possible configurations at once.
	% (2) taking a categorical perspecitve, viewing these data as all special kinds of maps.
	
	\begin{defn}
		A \textit{value} (on a random variable $X$) is a map $f : X  \to \mathfrak O$ where $\frak O$ is a category.
	\end{defn}

	Why a category? The objects are 
	%
	
	The important thing is that this map imbues $X$ itself with a categorical structure, as follows. Let $\bf X $ be 
	
	\begin{align*}
		\mathrm{ob}_{\bf X} &: \mathcal S_X \\
		\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf X}(x, x') &: 
	\end{align*}	

	% How do you know you've got the `best' value of x from this definition? Do I need extra structure in \frak O? 
	% 
	%	
	%	\begin{defn}
	%		A domain $f : X^k \to \mathfrak O$ is \textit{actionable} if $f$ induces a supremum, i.e., there is some $x \in X$ such that $\not\leq$
	%	\end{defn}
		
	
	\section{Reductions}
	
	The standard tool to represent values (and the ones that people are most familiar with) are orders, i.e., flat categories. 
	
	The simplest non-trivial order is:
	\begin{center}
		\raisebox{0.7em}{$\mathbb B = $}~\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node[pt=0] at (0,1){};
			\node[pt=1, right=1.2em of 0] {};
			\coordinate[below=0.3em of 0] (gutter);
			\node[right=0.6em of 0,anchor=center]{$\leqc$};
			\node[draw=gray, rounded corners=2, inner sep=0.5em, fit={\lab{0}\lab{1}(gutter)}] {}; 
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Desires}
	
	I want $\varphi$, is 
	
	One standard logical approach would be to give a Kripke model, so that a statment like $s \vDash W_{\alpha} \varphi$, for instance, would be true when agent $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ in state $s$. In such a model, there is already machinery for talking about the set of all possible states (call it $\cal W$), and so effectively we have specified a function $W_\alpha \varphi: \mathcal W \to \mathbb B$, which assigns 1 to worlds where $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ and 0 to the others.
	
	This is the behavior we would like to capture, but rather than use the set of possible worlds $\cal W$, we will adopt 
	
	
	\subsection{Utilities}
	
		
	
	A utility function $u : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ is a $\mathbb R$-value on the set of outcomes $\Omega$. 
	
	Effectively, 

	
	\subsection{Preferences}
	We can also consider orders which are not total; a discrete order encodes an inability to compare any of the options, lattices encode a possible inability to compare individual options, but provide a way to formalize the combination the best and worst features of two alternatives.
	
	
	An order is a function $\leq: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbbm 2$
