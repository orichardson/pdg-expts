%	This work an be motivated in many different ways; I imagine the most compelling one to depend on who you are and what you already care about. In any individual paper I plan to only include one of these, but until the audience has been narrowed, I want to keep all of them around. %to remind myself which directions I want to push, and to record selling points outside of the best publishing path.

	


	
%	\section{A Temporal Extension}
%	
%	Many issues with decision theory can be attributed to a failure to account for the passage of time. 
%	One popular example of this is the ubiquitous assumption of cognitive unboundedness: in a static world, where everything is frozen except your own thoughts, you can afford to do decision theory exactly by computing expected utility. You have only one decision to make
%	
%	Still, cognitive boundedness is only one example. When we move to a dynamic setting, most classical results no longer apply, though people often like to pretend that they do.

	\begin{defn}\label{def:mcg}
		A marginal constraint graph (MCG) is a tuple 
		\[ \left(\mathcal N : \mathbf{FinSet},~~\mathcal L : 2^{\cal N \times N},~~ \langle\mathcal S, \Sigma\rangle : \mathcal N \to \mathbf{MeasSet}, ~~\mathbf p : \prod_{(A,B): \mathcal L} \left[ \Big. \mathcal S_A \times \Sigma_B \to [0,1]\right] \right) \]
		where $p(L)$ is a Markov kernel, i.e., for every $L[A,B] : \mathcal L$, and $a \in \mathcal S_A$, $\mathbf p_L[a \mid \cdot~]$ is a probability distribution on $(\mathcal S_B, \Sigma_B)$, and $\mathbf p_L[~\cdot \mid B]$ is $\Sigma_A$-measurable for every $B \in \Sigma_B$.

	\part{Value Representations}
	
	The first strand of this project is a general representation of many ways that have been historically used to represent values: namely, utilities, goals, desires, preferences, choice functions, and natural extensions of these suggested by this representation, some of which are also well-studied. 
	
	\section{Setup}
	
	% There are two key insights / differences:
	% (1) allowing for a variety of scopes: you don't need to supply the data on all possible configurations at once.
	% (2) taking a categorical perspecitve, viewing these data as all special kinds of maps.
	
	The general idea is that to attach some additional preference data to each alternative in a domain
	
	\subsection{Definitions}
	

	
	\section{Reductions}
	
	The standard tool to represent values (and the ones that people are most familiar with) are orders, i.e., flat categories. 
	
	The simplest non-trivial order is:
	\begin{center}
		\raisebox{0.7em}{$\mathbb B = $}~\begin{tikzpicture}
			\node[pt=0] at (0,1){};
			\node[pt=1, right=1.2em of 0] {};
			\coordinate[below=0.3em of 0] (gutter);
			\node[right=0.6em of 0,anchor=center]{$\leqc$};
			\node[draw=gray, rounded corners=2, inner sep=0.5em, fit={\lab{0}\lab{1}(gutter)}] {}; 
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Desires}
	
	I want $\varphi$, is 
	
	One standard logical approach would be to give a Kripke model, so that a statment like $s \vDash W_{\alpha} \varphi$, for instance, would be true when agent $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ in state $s$. In such a model, there is already machinery for talking about the set of all possible states (call it $\cal W$), and so effectively we have specified a function $W_\alpha \varphi: \mathcal W \to \mathbb B$, which assigns 1 to worlds where $\alpha$ wants $\varphi$ and 0 to the others.
	
	This is the behavior we would like to capture, but rather than use the set of possible worlds $\cal W$, we will adopt 
	
	
	\subsection{Utilities}
	
		
	
	A utility function $u : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ is a $\mathbb R$-value on the set of outcomes $\Omega$. 
	
	Effectively, 

	
	\subsection{Preferences}
	We can also consider orders which are not total; a discrete order encodes an inability to compare any of the options, lattices encode a possible inability to compare individual options, but provide a way to formalize the combination the best and worst features of two alternatives.
	
	
	An order is a function $\leq: \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbbm 2$
