	\section{The problem with expressing impact as conditional probability.}
	
	When we say we have a domain of ``goodness'' $\sf U$, and a conditional probability distribution $\Pr(U \mid A)$, we are not expressing the goodness of $A$, rather estimating the goodness of the world where $A$ takes on various values. This is obviously a belief, and does not work as an expected utility calculation.  How to fix?
