I get scared when I see blank pages. I am scared I will write the wrong thing in
the wrong place. That the things that I make right now will get in the way of
the things I want to make in the future. But I should not be scared. Putting
something in the wrong place is something I do all the time. Even if I put things in the
wrong place everywhere, at least I will have things and be able to refile them whenever I want. The important thing is to ensure that I have

I just can't write if I can't modify the whole document. My mind refuses to focus.
I can't motivate myself to work in this way. I need to change it to write what I want to write.
