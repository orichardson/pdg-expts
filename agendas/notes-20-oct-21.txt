Causal conditioning should be monotonic.

Distribution over causal models --- less problematic. 

You can't say that beta requires units and then not say what the units are. 

\beta: cost per information?

If it has units, there has to be a serious discussion AT THE BEGINNING. The units can't be motivated by the semantics which don't exist yet. 

Joe's point: the discussion of scaling needs to be somewhere. If scale is going to be an issue, he would prefer to deal with it in the semantics, not in the definition. 

Could imagine: somebody saying they have a different measure of "goodness". Not changing the definition of a PDG, but introducing a new semantics. 
Would like to leave it open to make \beta scale-free.

Very happy no longer have to understand what a \beta=70 is.

Utils slightly better... but now problem: is now subjective, but probabilities seem objective.

 - degree of confidence \alpha \in [0,1]
 - Why is "$5 bad" a good notion?
