How to determine what commitment rules to use? 

Euclidean Update Rule?
Commutative if you have the same confidence?


WHat properties might a reasonable notion of confidence have?  When is it reasonable?  
Commutativity? Shortest Path? 

Define confidence as:
"Where you are on the path between ignoring input information and fully incorporating it"

"The obvious path" you should consider is the shortest path. 

Can formalize in many ways because intuition doesn't speak strongly about what the right metric is, or how it's parameterized, or what your belief space should look like.



"Fully Accepting"

ORDERING
	Belief \Phi
	Probabilities, Belief functions, plausibility measures. Each comes with (very few) notions of fully accepting. 
	
	Paths + Shortest path
