Variational Forms of KL divergence (Donsker etc)
  - http://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/data/LN_fdiv.pdf section

Is there a sense in which there's an underlying optimality criterion?

	easier: synthetic experiment to show: for this specific model, the loss funciton induced by the framework is better than some other random loss.

	Missing: notion of utility. Biggest risk: Nice but what do I do with that?


ISIT Feburary.

Would be cool if first publication to nail down graphical model stuff (AI stats maybe). Then send to information theoretic venue; say that you can understand relationships between divergences this way. Good to pin down with graphical model perspective first.
