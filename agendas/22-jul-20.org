What I've done
  - Some work on the document
  - Lots of notes and thoughts all over the place
  - Lots of self organization and trying to motivate myself and tricks and accountability that I've failed at
  - More note organization
  - Problem: logging is too hard and I forget. I get off track and I'm not sure when or how, or why time moves so fast


 Specific to the project
  - THE COMPUTATION
    Should be

    - Fixed points of the computation should correspond to old semantics.
    - SCHEDULER

      - markovity (a distribution over delta T for import)

Questions for Joe
 - Feedback on schedule: read in morning, summarize. Take lots of notes, summarize.
