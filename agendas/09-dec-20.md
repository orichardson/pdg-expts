# Personal
Working on both writeups. I started with one, and then switched between them. 

I get distracted by  ::
 - editor
 - cleaning up latex
 - trying to make sure I don't lose anything
 - trying to page in things from a long time ago


My mental workspace is super cluttered because I keep leaving things everywhere. 
 
	There are always distracting things on my screen. Is it possible to resolve them? I try to ignore them and it makes the problem worse.
