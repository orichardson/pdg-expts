... to compute inference queries like "what is the probability of Y given X"

2nd paragraph. OK, what does it even mean to answer the query P(Y|X). 
There is an issue; whereas BNs, FGs define unique distributions, it's more subtle.
So what do we do? Scoring function.
Used to define a semantics, that, 
Under mild assumptions, 
determines a unique distribution. 
We give algorithms to do PDG inference in polynomial time, for that distribution.

To do this, we had to look more carefully at the measure of inconsistency 

"As an added bonus, the same procedure also can be used to "

In our earlier paper, there's a way 

To answer that question,
