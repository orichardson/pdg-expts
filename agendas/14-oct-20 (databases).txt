Don't have to go backwards; you can do this with natural PDG operations. It's more than a bijection, but something like an isomorphism.

Have to argue that PDGs let us do more. 


if all you can do with PDGs is the same of databases.


 - using scoring function handle "inconsistency" better?
 - without even changing representation, can talk about places where independence doesn't hold. 
 

Do some stuff, might no longer have a DB that has all of the independencies, and also the probabilities. Do things, weird things happen. They don't interact well with the independencies; PDGs never had to make that assumption, but they will get the result you wanted. 

	The story we'd like to tell: we can do things with this representation. 
	
	The goal: show that this translation buys you something.
	Specific suggestions
		- deals with inconsistent databases
		- natural things you want to do don't play well with indep. assumptions. 
		
		Deliver examples.

 Best score -> answer to the best PDG
 What about all the other distributions?
