Look at distributions :
	how likely is a given \mu to be consistent?
		vs
	how consistent are you?
	
	Extension:
		How likely are you to be this inconsistent?
		How likely are you to be at most inconsistent?
		
		

 1. Assume confidence goes from [0,1].
	If we interpret \beta as convex combination,
	do we recover Inc do we recover expectations? 
	
 2. Go back to email and check all of the concerns.
	Do they disappear? 
	
If there are no intrinsic problems: we now have a semantics in PDGs for \beta, which 

 3. Figure out whether the story I was going to tell Joe interacts well with this?
