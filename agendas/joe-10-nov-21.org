* Research Things
** Dyna Paper & BP
*** Writing: altered the section of the paper on conditioning.

*** Proved that PDGs have the Markov Property
*** Gave counter-example for factoring over graph.
*** Chris suggested recursive decomposition. Doesn't seem to work

** Parameters \alpha and \beta.
*** More General formulation for measurable spaces.
*** Rewrite as transition Kernel, with tablet.
- < a1 - a2  | I_\mu - I \lambda>
*** Experimental Design
** Markov Chains
*** Chain That Makes Things More Consistent
Use case: a way to generate distributions consistent with a PDG

 - With SVD: gives dimension of the subspace of consistent dists


*** Experiments: Pentagon
Consistent DNs seem to be PDGs. See Images.
Evidence:
 - figure: inc reduction starting from factor product.
 - entropy vs IDef. Random Distributions.

** PDG Library; various QoL changes
 - MCMC support
 - Easier edge iteration

** Localizing Inc

* General
** How is treatment going?
** Internships
