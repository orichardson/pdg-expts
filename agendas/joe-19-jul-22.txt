NEW LAPOP
	SILLY
		My laptop is 100 years old.
		It is older than you, and its is now harder to explain things to my laptop than to you. I want to upgrade at least one thing in my life. Since I like you, I've decided on my laptop.
	
	ACTUAL
		My laptop is 7.5 years old. It's been lagging. I can't compile things and there's not a lot of space. I'm going to buy a laptop. Is it standard to get something like this reimbursed? 
		
CONFIDENCE ARGUMENTS
	1. [0,\infty] over [0,1]
		> "fraction of the way there" might not be compatible with the metric.
		> Doesn't work for "update until convergence" --- the path to fully incorporating information is defined locally (as is the state of full incorporation), and does not linearly interpolate. 
		
		Intuition:
			How many small incremental steps of partial incorporation? 
			> Works in all cases.  Follows from differentiability.
