## Results to Merge In

 * `[?]` Hinge Loss
 * Generic Loss 
     * Note: additional complexity, more difficult to defend. 
 * Generative Models

 * GANs
 * For $\gamma=1$, inconsistency is log cosine similarity.

    Is this true?

 
# Discussion

From Email.

I'm particularly interested in whether you buy the overall story at a high level. If so, and supposing that you still think that this picture is a poor model of an agent's preferences / utilities, I would be interested in understanding what makes the two settings different in your view, given that loss, cost, and (dis)utility are generally interchangeable. 


### Pragmatic Reasoning
A defense of optimisim: belif in good
You should believe in good.
