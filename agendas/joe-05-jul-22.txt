AGENDA
	- Thomas: biweekly meetings. idea of divergenes.
	
	INFERENCE
		Fixing bugs; trying to get graphite to run.
		Still haven't run experiments. 
	
	CONFIDENCE
		- Now on board with 'fraction of the way there' --- but it's not as measured by the geometry.
			- Think: epsilon of the way there, then epsilon of the remaining way, then....   Zeno says it takes infinite time to get there. 
		
		- For every difflble commitment function, there's a unique additive one which is locally equivalent. 
		
		- Distances are still infinite. 
		
		
		- go through two example URs (euclidean, and Fisher) in terms of two different confidence parameterizations, and all three representations. 
		
		- Talk about PDG update rules.
