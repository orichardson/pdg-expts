#+TITLE: Joe Meeting 10 May 22


* Connections to Mathematics
** Control Theory
*** Lyaupanov Exponents.
** Lee Smooth Manifolds
*** Integral Flows over Vector Field;
Left (R,+) action on \Theta.
Differentiability <=> smooth action.
"One-Parameter Lie Group"
*** Can't take gradients without a Riemannian Metric.
** Natural Gradients
** Chentsov's Theorem
Update Rule requirement: follows geodesics?

* The Enormous Purview of Update Rules
** Dempster-Shaffer Belief Functions.
*** Result: Works.
** Neural Networks + Samples.
Confidence = probability of sample occurance.
** Exponential Families + Samples.
** Simplex (Distribution) + Observation

* Examples
** General Exponential Families
** Gaussian Distributions
*** The naive update rule doesn't make sense. Gradient descent does.
*** Wrote code implementing Gaussian updates

* New Axioms
** IIA
Counter-example.
