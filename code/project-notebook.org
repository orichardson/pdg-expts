#+TITLE: Project Notebook


* INFERENCE
** CVXPY inference algorithm [0/2]
*** TODO Auto-generate cliques of graph
*** TODO Something about convex-concave algorithm, for large alpha?

* VIZ
** QUEUE
*** DONE Refactor drawing modes
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "STRT"       [2022-05-26 Thu 15:01]
:END:
Remove "Select" as a mode.
Make it, as well as the "t" key, special submodes, that only apply for
a single operation.

*** STRT Actions + Keystroke Display
Make such "Special Operations" visually clear and automatically display which ones are available. Important for ease of use

*** Visual [2/9]
**** DONE draw labels
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-05-23 Mon 16:02]
:END:
**** KILL change \delta (edge offset) + length parameters of hyperedges
:LOGBOOK:
- State "KILL"       from "TODO"       [2022-05-23 Mon 16:02]
:END:
**** TODO Possibility of multiple nodes per link.
 - Make longer edges this way w / control of way points, like a mesh or curve in blender.
 -
**** TODO make self-edges prettier
One possibility: multiple link nodes.
**** TODO double-headed arrows
Idea: Ctrl + click
**** TODO circle-tailed arrows
**** TODO Alter node sizes cleanly, as text is modified.
**** TODO MathJax in Nodes

:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-06-02 Thu 13:33]
:END:
**** TODO When selected: drag entire selection in manipulate mode

*** Structure Editing
**** STRT Moving.
Blender style
**** TODO Scaling.
Issue: distances are for pairs of connected nodes / links.
So how do you scale things separately?
**** TODO Duplicate Selection w/"D" or ctrl + drag
**** TODO Copy, Cut, Paste,
**** TODO Rename labels

*** Physics + Layout
**** TODO Allow linknodes to pass through nodes that they are connected to, in transition to a more stable state.
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-06-02 Thu 13:32]
:END:
**** TODO Re-layout (tunneling + non-local force search)
**** TODO Stretchiness that adapts to tension
**** TODO Simulation Less Baked-In; More Permanent Node placements
***** Idea: define a "view" that includes PDG node placements.
 > But what's a nice way to select views?
    + names + search :: state is not very visible.
    + scrolling :: even less so
    + buttons on bottom :: cluttered.
Seems to be too much state.



***** Idea: A Selector for {full simulation, }
***** Idea: A button "run simulation on (all but) selected elements".
***** Idea: "Float" property. Simulation is run on those nodes with float property.
Nodes can be anchored with click.

*** Edge Focus
**** TODO CPD editor

*** Node Focus
**** STRT Value Editor
**** TODO Associate list to each node
**** TODO Edit Name.
**** See: Multi-PDG below

*** Workflow
**** TODO UNDO
**** TODO Camera

**** TODO snap
**** TODO Flip through folder of PDG structures, with annotations
**** TODO Drag to select without "b" key, so you can just use mouse.
**** MAYBE Export to something matplotlib can display.

*** Multi-PDG [0/3]
**** TODO Nested Borders (Compress full PDGs as nodes + folding)
**** TODO Split and Merge functionality
**** TODO Move entire PDGs around the screen


** WISHLIST
*** Other Inputs
**** Draw on Tablet
**** Parse from Image
*** Importing of other formats
**** .csv
**** graph formats (.dot, ...)
**** .pdg files
**** Class Graph / Objet Graph from javascript
*** Queries + Analytics
**** Inconsistency
**** Visualize a Joint distribution
**** Information Diagrams (both for joint dists + PDGs)

** FINISHED
*** [X] bounding box for nodes
*** [X] edge labels in hypergraph
*** [X] new "node" for each hypergraph
*** [X] repulsion between edges
*** [X] add "new node" tool
*** [X] add "new hyperedge" tool
*** [X] selection: (nodes + edges)
*** [X] selection operators: union, subtraction
*** [X] drawing selection
*** [X] painting selection
*** [X] add to hyperedges w/drawing
*** [X] select edges
*** [X] import / export


* FEATURE WISHLIST
