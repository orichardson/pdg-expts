	\section{Motivation}
	Is this active learning? Yes. What if there's a cost to observing directed samples, and also a cost for computation.
	
	You're trying to make decisions, but are cognitively bounded and only have samples to go on. From \cite{opt-from-samples}, we know there are classes of functions which cannot be learned passively from samples, and moreover, thought is expensive, and boundedness needs to be taken seriously. %\cite{gershman2015computational}
	
	So we have to pay for

		\item Computation
		\item Inaccuracy
		\item Directed Samples
